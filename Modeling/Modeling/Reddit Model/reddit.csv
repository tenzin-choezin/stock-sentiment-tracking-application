I'm trying to yolo some cash that I don't have on some PayPal or Meta PUTS to probably lose later on another shit trade that's inevitable to happen. My smooth brained donkey ass is thinking another big drop will happen on either of those two stonks listed above. Does anyone w a slight wrinkle think this plan could go accordingly and if so which one, if not both? I see both Meta and PayPal took a good hit today w put weekly option contracts up about 1000%, give or take, which is juicy enough to wanna yolo tendies I really don't have to make hopefully more tendies I desperately fucking need. Any input would be appreciated, I am literally just taking a stab in the dark but it seems that sometimes those are the best plays.

If NFLX is the harbinger then trace back 3-5 years which Netflix has done with this sell off.  Todays $226 is the Jan 18 high.  

All of this is better than a crash because it is a semi controlled crash 

Be in cash 

Pick your retrace:  2019 or 2018. I don‚Äôt think any bounce off a bottom will be solid and most good stocks will fork a channel between hi-lo 2020 prices imo

If you look at a 2-5 year chart you can see it",5,u7wzvg,2022-04-20T14:02:58Z,2022-04-20

Is it that simple? ""I think this will go down."" -- or is it more like ""I think this will go down by x amount.""

Sorry, wife's bf doesn't let me on the computer much. I'm behind.

Also, congrats and fuck you.

EDIT: Did some research on my own. So basically, yes. If you have a put option and the stock price goes down, you can sell the option for a profit in most cases. Further, put options decrease in value over time since they are losing time value. You *really* gotta call it correctly to make good money. 

TL;DR: If you buy a put option, you want the stock price to go down as quickly as possible. Intrinsic value of the put option decreases over time according to the terms you select.",12,u7wtfh,2022-04-20T15:31:44Z,2022-04-20

9 - 9:30 wondered if I would still have a job the next day, drank lot's of coffee, and said ""everything looks about right ""

after the opening happened and we could start trading ( more delays for some reason and order imbalance ) 

shorted out of the money puts @ 27 to 29 range that was in the morning. 

by lunch they were @ 20

by 3pm they were @ 7

I closed the position and never traded volatility again. 

2 things I learned personally, this won't apply to many people but it applied to me and my character of trading. 

I learned that day, if I have a long position on, and it goes screaming in my favor with a huge volatility, close it, sit back and come into the trade again when it's somewhat normal.

I learned that day, don't go short volatility because I don't have the nerves for it.",2,u7wtfh,2022-04-20T17:05:24Z,2022-04-20

460,nflx,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Seriously NFLX is ran by apes,"Watching Nflx shit the bed is so satisfying. 

Boomers getting paid more money than we will ever see keep making the same awful decision year after year after year.

This will go down as one of the biggest fails by a production studio. Throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks is fine as long as we don‚Äôt have to see the failed products. I cannot find titles on Netflix without potentially getting baited into one of the worst movies I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life. They are doing charity work for awful first time directors.

You idiots had a 10 year head start. You had a great engineering team that made one of the best quality playback engines. But you decided to destroy your reputation by pumping dogshit to fill the hole left by departing titles. They were probably scared shitless that stockholders would panic if they saw total # of films go down, so they decided to become the streaming equivalent a magazine-filled Walmart checkout line instead. 

This news will only serve as a notification for people to cancel their subscription. Next month will be awful for them. Hype it up",30,u7s1ye,2022-04-20T09:55:11Z,2022-04-20

I for one only care for one or two shows they produce, neither of which justify the monthly price.

Holders of those stocks should be on alert.","It's not just the pandemic. The industry is saturated. The competitive field has widened. Everyone has had Netflix for ages. They're trying out other pay for services. Maybe they'll go back to Netflix at some point but now they're giving Hulu or AppleTV or Paramount or Disney Plus a shot.  Consumers are also pissed Netflix raised their price. Dumb move if you ask me, put them on the radar for households to be a service to cut. Some would have just continued to keep paying but the publicity from the uptick in price, even if it truly was an inseconsequential amount for most consumers caused faux shock and outrage so for some this was a trigger to cancel. Other consumers for whom money is tight, are using services that help them identify and manage subscriptions they aren't heavily using so that they can more easily cancel them.  It's just that the market is changing and Netflix isn't the only show in town.",10,u7q7xg,2022-04-20T06:57:28Z,2022-04-20

* 220 million \* $1 \* 12 months =   + $2.64 billion per year in extra revenue.

Revenue loss from 200,000 subscribers, we'll say at $12.50 on average is:

* 200,000 \* $12.50 \* 12 = $30 million per year

Revenue loss from 2 million subscribers.  At $13 on average is :

* 2,000,000 \* $13 \* 12 = $312 million

Net annual revenue change:

* $2.64 billion - $30 million - $312 million =  Netflix making an extra $2.298 billion per year.

I believe we are on the cusp of a paradigm change where more people will subscribe to one maybe two streaming channels watch what you like then cancel the sub and move to another one.

616,nflx,wallstreetbets,POST,Everyone‚Äôs going on about NFLX after-hours when $DIS caught a bit of that heat‚Ä¶ earnings predictions for $DIS?,"Man oh man what a day for streaming!

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll have good streaming #‚Äôs until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

Disney murdered the Star Wars franchise with their woke nonsense. Netflix can't develop anything interesting because they've knelt to the woke agenda. Twitter, Facebook, all of them will see major collapse.

The woke agenda destroys creativity and humor, it kills storytelling and makes thing less relatable not more.  The entire entertainment industry will continue to collapse because of this.  Will Smith slapping a comedian for telling a joke is a clear sign of just how bad it's getting.  Jesters have always functioned as a check on the powerful, and the powerful are now checking them.

Maintaining the woke agenda will destroy all companies that embrace it, as it destroys everything it touches.",38,u7k4b6,2022-04-20T00:58:00Z,2022-04-20

They‚Äôll beat even in regards of streaming and no one will be surprised.

875,nflx,StockMarket,POST,Wait and see: Wall Street ditching Netflix (NFLX.US),"Netflix's ([NFLX.US](https://NFLX.US)) first-quarter 2022 earnings report released after the U.S. stock market on Tuesday was once again surprising, and major Wall Street banks have also lowered their target prices for the stock. U.S. stocks plummeted more than 27% in pre-market trading to $253.03.

According to the financial report, Netflix‚Äôs total revenue in the first quarter was $7.87 billion, a year-on-year increase of 9.8%, but lower than the market‚Äôs expected $7.93 billion; diluted earnings per share were $3.53, down nearly 6% from $3.75 in the same period last year. , but above analysts' expectations of $2.89.

However, the indicator of global net increase in paying users, which investors are most concerned about, unexpectedly showed negative growth. The loss of 200,000 global paid subscribers in the first quarter was the first negative value since 2011, while Netflix had previously expected an increase of 2.5 million. In addition, Netflix's second-quarter guidance was also disappointing. The company expects to lose 2 million paid users worldwide in the second quarter, compared with the market's forecast of 2.4 million new additions.

By region, subscribers in North America decreased by 640,000, subscribers in EMEA decreased by 300,000, subscribers in Latin America decreased by 350,000, and subscribers in Asia Pacific increased by 1.09 million.

Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that ""revenue growth has slowed significantly"", the entry of traditional media has led to increased competition in the streaming media industry, household penetration has been relatively high, and more than 100 million households worldwide share accounts with others, and inflation is eroding people. The budget allocation for non-essential items such as subscription services, as well as the temporary withdrawal from the Russian market and the closure of user accounts, all adversely affected revenue growth.

After Netflix's really ""ugly"" earnings report was announced, all major Wall Street banks lowered their target prices for the stock. The following are some investment banks' views on the stock:

Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft lowered his price target on Netflix to $300 from $465 and maintained a ""hold"" rating on the stock.

While the first-quarter results fell short of market expectations, Netflix management is making a strategic and tactical shift to focus on ""how best to monetize the phenomenon of different households sharing the same account,"" analysts said, with a rollout that includes Advertising subscription services. Given that Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãnow ""on the flattened part of the demand curve in most Western markets,"" these measures will be needed to re-accelerate growth. Analysts said Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãexpected to experience accelerated growth again in the second half of 2023 and in 2024.

Stifel analyst Scott Devitt lowered his price target on Netflix to $300 from $460 and downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy.""

""All good growth stories come to an end eventually,"" the analyst said. Analysts pointed to Netflix's first-quarter and second-quarter guidance as ""disappointing,"" with the company posting negative user growth in three of its four major regions. Analysts said Netflix still needs to address some longer-term issues, including increased competition, the possibility that its core market has matured and the prevalence of shared accounts, which could be a drag on its growth. Analysts say subscription services that include ads and increased monetization of shared accounts are in the early stages of development and won't be possible until the second half of 2023.

Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion lowered his price target on Netflix to $293 from $562 and downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight.""

Analysts pointed out that Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter, which was significantly lower than the 2.5 million newly expected by the market; the company's management pointed out a series of problems affecting the future growth of subscribers, including the macro environment, shared accounts and increased competition. Analysts said Netflix's user loss will continue into the second quarter, and its revenue growth slowdown may continue into 2023, ""this is a low-growth, low-visibility model, which prompts us to stay on the sidelines.""

Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar lowered his price target on Netflix to $275 from $380 and maintained a ""wait-and-see"" rating on the stock.

Analysts said that even the most pessimistic forecasts did not expect negative user growth in three of Netflix's four main regions, and such negative user growth could occur in the second quarter. Analysts also noted that Netflix itself does not appear to be bullish on near-term profit margin growth, saying it depends on a re-acceleration of revenue growth.

Pivotal Research lowered its price target on Netflix to $235 from $550 and downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from ""buy.""

The analyst said Netflix's first-quarter subscriber numbers and weak second-quarter subscriber guidance were ""shocking,"" and he lowered his forecasts for the company's user growth and earnings. Analysts believe that Netflix's consideration of launching a subscription service that includes advertising but costs less is a negative, ""compared to the current good consumer experience, this move reduces the value of the brand and product."" The analyst noted that in a period of rising interest rates, slumping profitability could make the stock ""unpopular with the investment community.""

In addition, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth downgraded Netflix from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"" with a target price of $300; ‚Äã‚ÄãUBS analyst John Hodulik downgraded Netflix from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" ‚Äù, with a target price of $355; Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber downgraded Netflix from ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù to ‚Äúneutral‚Äù with a target price of $280.",3,u7va6o,2022-04-20T12:23:51Z,2022-04-20

932,nflx,stocks,POST,"NFLX plummeted 35%, and its teammates, who were as stupid as pigs, dragged down FB, DIS, ROKU, and AMZN by themselves.","NFLX suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, sending its shares plunging 25% in extended trading amid fears that the groundbreaking streaming service may have had its best days.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Do you think this is logical?

In my non qualified, non professional opinion and story, I subscribe to at least 5 different streaming services. They include Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV+, and Paramount+. Netflix is the only one up on the chopping block because it‚Äôs more expensive than the others, is too inconsistent with their content, and with the password crackdown I soon won‚Äôt be able to share with family.

From an average consumer perspective in America, why would I not cancel it and either: A) Subscribe when a big show comes out then cancel immediately, or B) Pirate all of their shit

They peaked about 4-5 years ago and now they‚Äôre reaping what they‚Äôve sown. Plus, if we‚Äôre speaking about emotional reactions, how about their reaction to all of this? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to scale back content, the main reason people subscribe in the first place.‚Äù

Originally, it was a disruptor bringing unlimited DVD rentals to consumers via mail for a super low price. Then, disrupting the industry more by moving to streaming. Sadly, a lot of the larger studios whose films likely account for more than HALF of all popular films in existence got smart and decided to launch their own platforms. To combat this, Netflix has been forced to invest HEAVILY in new, original content. While this has worked for the past couple years, the amount of new content (as well as the demand) just cannot keep up with the amount of lost content to other streaming services.

1016,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Anyone else think -29% on NFLX is a bit overdone?!?,"I think its overdone.

plan flexibility is a good idea. its part of the reason why the other platforms have (sort of) caught up. the sharing password thing is a no-duh from a corp/investor point of view. I get why customers disagree, but combining with plan flexibility they could easily lower prices for single/double streams and offer their high tier plan as a multi-stream.

im a little concerned about running down the creative budget and I agree with the criticisms that they shut down series too soon. imo Netflix should be a place where obscure series thrive. granted, there is always a cost, but it should strive to maintain that rep rather then a rep of shutting shows down.

internationally, I think Netflix beats all. I personally hate when I see a show that looks awesome, only to learn its in Polish, but most of the world is used to watching American movies with subtitles. which means that awesome polish show has more appeal worldwide than it does to people like me. 

I like HBO, but it isn't the end-all. overall the quality is better, but the selection isn't as vast. I see this as a positive (for HBO) in some ways, but bottom line is that it doesnt really replace Netflix. paramount/peacock/apple are small time. I do the $5 subs because they are almost free (see above). I dont watch Hulu, so I cant comment on it, but I never hear about any really good content on Hulu (other than Handmaids Tale). if there was, it would draw me to it. Prime is... I dont know. it has some good series, but otherwise just seems like a non-player. 

it sucks seeing it drop like this. I am worried. but ive withstood drops before and will again. nothing has really changed for me on Netflix except that it will take a while to grow confidence of many. hopefully this signals to the board that they need to get in gear because its a new landscape. plan flexibility is a big start to that and its not a negative for investor or customer.",1,u7w8nr,2022-04-20T14:06:58Z,2022-04-20

If the concern that Netflix growth is now non-existent (or worse, shrinking), it needs to have a PE of value company (ie., 15-17). The earning call indicates that management doesn't know when Netflix will resume its growth. In fact, it projected that another shrinkage of 2M subscribers is coming in the next quarter. 

The next challenge for Netflix is to go from focusing on subscriber growth to squeezing more dollars out of its existing base. To know if Netflix can do this or not will take expertise way beyond mine. What is clear is that you cannot just take the recent 30% fall as a reason to buy.

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll have good streaming #‚Äôs until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

1158,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Netflix (NFLX) reported an unexpected decline in first-quarter net subscribers,"Even if NFLX drops 25% tomorrow it would still be overvalued IMO. There's just not enough money to be made in content alone. Content is not a strong moat, and without a moat you have zero pricing power and crappy margins. If I can get decent enough content on Disney+ with ads or with my Amazon Prime subscription then why wouldn't I just find stuff to watch there?

They need find other monetisation streams or to build out a more fully-featured streaming platform. What Disney does right is that content is just a starting point. If your kid likes Frozen or Marvel they're going to want all the Frozen and Marvel gizmos for Christmas, and they're going to beg you all year to take them to Disney World. Disney only cares about content as much as it provides them with unique IP that they can sell experiences and products with pricing power. It drives me nuts that I have to spend ¬£30 on some crappy plastic Marvel toy every Christmas, but that's the genius of what Disney does, if your kid wants the latest spiderman toy, you're probably going to buy it regardless of price. This probably why Disney is fine with an ad model. They can lose money on the content itself so long as they can make enough money elsewhere from that content.

I'm not sure Netflix can replicate the theme park & merch model of Disney, but they could explore alternatives like video games and include that in their subscription. If Netflix offered me a library of video content, video games, music & audiobooks, I'd probably be more happy to pay their prices -- especially if it meant I could cancel my Spotify subscription. As it stands the only reason I still pay for Netflix is because my girlfriend likes to watch Friends on there. It's a total waste of money, but I cba to argue about it. If they continue to try to compete on content alone the stock should probably trade with a PE in the mid-teens.",22,u7e8x7,2022-04-19T20:46:01Z,2022-04-19

1280,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Thoughts on Netflix ($NFLX) Earnings today after hours?,"Netflix's problems are its problems alone, and I have been predicting this for a year or two. first they have no real library and can no longer easily license from studios. Second they have never really operated on free cashflow but on borrowing, so they are cash poor.  Third, their huge global reach is largely based on poor'ish people sharing access codes, so one paying sub delivers Netflix to 20-30 people.  My condo in Mexico recently cut off Netflix service because Netflix was forcing them to buy a different sub for ever unit when previously one sub took care of 40 units.  My Colombian girlfriend long watched Netflix on borrowed or stolen codes, that is how they all do it down here in Latin America.

So, Netflix may have to overhaul itself, but how?  Now WBD and Disney both have better product and PARA, Apple and Amazon are about equal.  Maybe Netflix can buy Columbia or give Sony hgakf its stock in excghange for Columbia, since Netflix has no cash. But I would not wnt to try to figure that one out now.  The best service now is HBO-Discovery. And that and PARA are also the two stocks to buy, in fact buy them today with the 6% discount caused by the company thei are taking market share from, Netflix,",0,u7a3t0,2022-04-20T11:55:52Z,2022-04-20

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe.

1. logic of yolo'er is that because netflix got screwed, its somehow Tesla's turn. they are in completely different area of business

2. i see ton of teslas in my hood and we are talking canada here

3. even if it dips, apes will just buy up whatever the ask price is

4. shanghai/shenzen locking down won't impact this quarter, Q2 maybe, definitely Q3 & Q4.

for these three reasons i think it is unwise to purchase 2dte puts",8,u8290p,2022-04-20T17:51:05Z,2022-04-20

The price increases have moved it from entry luxury to mid range luxury prices.",-3,u7xy3v,2022-04-20T19:33:09Z,2022-04-20

1552,tsla,wallstreetbets,POST,"True believer in Elon and TSLA even now. Here‚Äôs what I know, and my question: how do I best yolo so my kids can have little Tesla ATVs","Tesla is sitting over $1,000 today after bouncing back (again) from around $800. Our favorite fund manager, Cathie Wood, and the team at ARK smoke the $4,600 a share hopium as soon as they wake up in the morning. If they‚Äôre right (and they always, always are) then we‚Äôre looking at 450% return on the stock over the next several years. That‚Äôs great, but I don‚Äôt have the dry powder to buy enough stock to change lives. 

Here are my reasons why I really, truly do believe this company is going even higher: and they aren‚Äôt what you expect. 

1: I genuinely feel for Elon as a human being. If you care to watch him closely in moments of contemplation, he isn‚Äôt all 420 jokes and dog memes. This is a man who is badly scarred from childhood, still struggling to fix the world around him like he could never do for himself. This is the type of deep, foundational pain that most people don‚Äôt understand but, for those of us who do, explains so much about how driven to obsessive he is. This is a man who is going to literally change the course of human history because he can‚Äôt change his own. 

2: Tesla isn‚Äôt a car company. The things that excite me about the next 3-5 years have nothing to do with that sexy, sexy S Plaid. I‚Äôm talking robots. I‚Äôm talking battery technology, capacity, and vertical integration. I‚Äôm talking about AI that goes beyond autonomous vehicles. I‚Äôm talking about Optimus. Come on! The name is literally Optimus!

3: Scale. Elon is all about scale. More, faster, better, and cheaper as they grow. Even while raw materials shoot through the roof, they‚Äôre acquiring the whole chain. They‚Äôre making everything they can in house or own the suppliers. That type of scalability is literally unheard. 

So I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm all in. I‚Äôm going to sell my crap stocks like <insert everything> and buy up whatever I can. 

However, I just bought a home and my kid is about to go to a stupidly, ridiculously expensive college. I foolishly sold 35 shares to help buy shelter so I‚Äôm down to just 15. Picking up a few shares now and then when it dips isn‚Äôt going to cut it for me. So this has got to be some crazy option play. Exactly what that play is though is TBD.

Positions: 15 shares, no options yet, but a legit, in the wild, true believer.",20,u7mn07,2022-04-20T02:59:18Z,2022-04-20

The offer to buy out Twitter can only happen if 1 of 2 things happens:

* Elon Musk sells his stock in TSLA (and owns less of TSLA going forward); or
* Elon Musk uses his stock as collateral to leverage some massive level debt in order to buy Twatter.

Lets assume he uses his TSLA stock as leverage... I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122. They probably got a peak, were happy with what they saw and were good with him putting an offer forward for the 43 billy for Twatter because the stock (what he'll use for collateral) will continue to rise in value going forward PRIOR to Q122 earnings date.

Am I reading too much into this and going full tard or am I making sense? Are my TSLA 1050 5/20 calls going to print?",1,u55db3,2022-04-16T19:35:11Z,2022-04-16

6. Your point is good that he will use TSLA as leverage somehow.

1766,tsla,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,10k overnight by accidentally buying 10x the TSLA puts I was trying to.,"First real gain porn I can post since MSFT offer for ATVI became public and my ATVI leaps skyrocketed.

I was literally shitting bricks yesterday at close. My normal principal for positions is 300-800. 1-2k is a big bet for me. 10k was like 20% of my portfolio. On margin.

I was trying to purchase just one of the 1015p when it was slightly OTM at 3:12. Etrade pro defaults to 10 contracts when you go to the trade screen to enter an order, and I was not paying attention to my order size when I entered the limit. 5 mins later, HUGE green shrek dicks ripped 3k off of my puts. I tried not to panic and asked if I would hold this position overnight if it was 1/10 the size it was. I would, and so I held the 10 puts. 

I did not waste a single second at open, immediately entered my order at 19 which was the bid price at open, and it was filled within a minute. Still shook over how lucky I got.",6,u3krtr,2022-04-14T16:04:40Z,2022-04-14

This strategy invests 100% in TSLA when the current price falls below the 200-day moving average.   
When the price rises above the 200-day moving average, the symphony shifts 30% of the portfolio into short-term treasuries. The symphony seeks to reduce volatility relative to TSLA while still participating in the upside. 

Feedback welcome.

1783,tsla,wallstreetbets,POST,TSLA Micro DD; The most condensed and valuable TSLA DD you'll ever need,"($12,000 GAAP earnings per EV sold) \* (20,000,000 EVs sold annually) \* (50 P/E) =

$12T market cap or approximately $12,000/share

Do I expect these numbers to happen? I dunno, doesn't matter what I think.. but you know what's important? The extraordinary potential upside for TSLA. I encourage everyone to use your own numbers. This DD will aim to educate you on identifying what these three numbers could become, and how to keep track of TSLA as an investment

1) GAAP earnings per EV

|Quarter|GAAP EPS|EVs Delivered|GAAP earnings per EV sold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021 Q1|$0.39|184,800|$2,361|
|2021Q2|$1.02|201,250|$5,671|
|2021 Q3|$1.44|241,300|$6,677|
|2021 Q4|$2.05|308,650|$7,432|

Your homework: How is GAAP earnings per EV going up? and How high will it go? These are not easy questions to answer. You have to dig. Check out ASP, gross margin and operating margin for Tesla, as well as their trends. Understand Economies of Scale and Wright's Law. Look into the innovation that Tesla is attempting in building EVs. Finally, every quarter.. do your math! GAAP earnings per EV = (GAAP EPS \* outstanding shares)/(EVs delivered). Use [ir.tesla.com](https://ir.tesla.com) as your source

2) EVs sold annually

This is the biggest risk to Tesla and most important thing to monitor imo: execution. Their goal is 50% growth in sales YoY. To be bullish, we have to see them hit that goal.

Homework: Do your math to predict sales based on 50% growth YoY, and watch to see if they achieve their goal. They sold 936,000 in 2021, if they grow at 50% YoY, what year will they reach 20M?

3) P/E

Unfortunately, there will always be speculation here. Tesla will likely always try to innovate and find new businesses to grow. They're currently focused on Solar and Energy, FSD and the Tesla Bot in addition to EVs. So long as there's new innovative business opportunities, what P/E value does that justify? Your homework is to make your own speculation here. 25 P/E? 50 P/E? 10 P/E? You decide.

&#x200B;

Lastly, use your own numbers! Decide if this upside is really there, and if you decide that TSLA could continue to grow, then you're now equipped with some nice metrics to follow and help you maintain conviction in your holding.

And those share prices mean nothing without an oustanding shares amount. Nio is still far from priced ""fairly"" just like Tesla is an overpriced EV stock.. worse is that its a Chinese stock with no actual inhouse production and its growing at a slower rate than Tesla while being horribly unprofitable. Stock can go easily -50% from this point. With Tesla thats less of a risk actually even with how stupidly overpriced they are now. They are making good profits have incredible efficient factories of which an additonal 2 opened and it seems like unlimited demand.. Before 2023 end they will approach 3 million cars sold annualy and thats not even accounting for their energy segment. WIth current pricing their PE would be somewhere 80-100 range.

1895,gme,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,GME and AMC,"Both are dinosaurs and novelties of a past era. Their cultural relevance was little to none before the 'short squeeze' of 2021 happened.

If you'll remember, GME's market cap went *lower* than its book value, which is its real assets such as real estate, inventory, etc. That's weird, but not uncommon when companies are tumbling down. It's an indication that people who were trying to make a buck off its downfall, got greedy and pushed the price way below what the market considered fair.

That's ultimately how we're in the situation today. Of course, GME brought in new leadership and are rapidly trying to adapt its business. Hard to gauge their potential given the competitors in all the spaces GME is trying to grow, but anyway.",8,u7y65j,2022-04-20T15:09:49Z,2022-04-20

As shareholders of any company (please set aside Twitter for the purpose of this discussion), would you be satisfied if a $48 stock went as high as $54? Are you claiming that THAT was your ultimate price target...a $6 increase from the current value??

Twitter is not speculation. It is and always has been a long-term investment. IMHO, Twitter has a growth potential, and is one of those companies that could go high into the triple digits.

I brought up GME for a reason. Most of us have ""the moon"" as a price target for GME. Whatever that is remains personal and subjective, but it's fair to presume that it's WAY ABOVE $150/share. I dare say, it's up in the 4-digit land. Please tell me I'm off here. Elon's offer of $54 is about 12% more than current. Taking that same percentage, $165/share would be Elon's offer for GME.

1988,gme,wallstreetbets,POST,I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.,"# Post too long, here is TLDR:

Efficient market hypothesis sucks balls because GME is being traded around it's SI rather than it's performance. Overall market go poo poo if theory is true once dividends populate. You go homeless.  I go homeless. Death from starvation.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

GameStop's share price is **completely void of the company's performance.**

There is no mathematical financial model for measuring (let alone forecasting) this motive fueling GME's price-movement. I can't think of a stock to-date that has ever been valued this way.  Meaning, value found in the stock pertains to new information about it's speculated SI let alone it's SI borrow rate.

Remember all those important ratios that tell us about a companies performance? *Useless*. Even better are option prices--which for most days, are *hysterical*. The average cost for call options usually equal the cost for puts with rarely ever a one-sided sentiment because too many people are assigning value to it's SI rather than the company's performance. BIG PICTURE, nobody knows where the hell this thing will go each day. If people by the dozens are buying this stock based on speculation around information not just separate from GameStop's performance, but a whole other company's activities, doesn't this make CAPM and other models around return obsolete? *I mean, this is speculation on a massive scale.*  Speculation around private information that is no less private than it has been since day one.

To narrow this, EMH doesn't account for **any other alternative motive besides the company's performance** and or actions tied the federal reserve.  *This is how the market SHOULD work. This is the market structure assumed to be in place not just for EMH, but for most investors/traders.* Price instead is valued around SI populated daily from [iborrow.com](https://iborrow.com) where, once the price drops to a certain point and borrow rates go up, institutions + retail will unload the buying turning returns (eventually) into a cyclical time trend.

This isn't to say EMH doesn't account for short-selling (ss) or that ss is bad, but instead, *how out of control abusive naked short selling can get which for GME, if true,* ***is VERY bad***.  We'll find out come June 2022 once dividends are official. If it's true, a cancerous bubble might pop bringing the whole market down with it. Mass-wide margin calls will be made to keep banks up afloat which will end in liquidation equal too (maybe greater) than 2008. This would literally justify why wall street was having a melt-down from what spawned in this sub. A years worth of shorting the stock plus more all because Citadel refused to take the L that came from Melvin's doings by shorting the stock a 140%. That and nobody is buying the reported SI from FINRA.  Not when $50k for ""egregious behavior"" are assigned for misreporting data. It's like the equivalent of stepping on Legos for punishment of destroying the economy.

The markets crashing in the event this bubble pops will likely be the ***least of anyone's concerns anyways.*** This is because *not a damn soul* will be dumb enough to give wall street their hard-earned money again. Not when market makers have the leverage they do to bring down the economy and everyone else's money over fucking GAMESTOP! Markets will become vastly illiquid simply because regulation doesn't regulation shit and putting your money into the markets is now a suckers game--just like playing slots. Everyone from the SEC, CFTC, market-makers and even institutions not involved will all lose the needed trust of the American people which as of now, is equivalent to nicking a main artery. Not a single American will accept ""more regulation"" as an answer for soundly regulating the markets. If the government cares to have a functioning market, functioning economy, you'll need the trust of the middle-class which likely means one thing: Prison for everyone complicit or nothing.

Anyways, this is my ted talk, I appreciate ya if you took the time to read this. I will be presenting this (plus more) next week in front of 2,000+ people downtown Chicago 10 minutes away from Citadel.

There is no rational market. The unstoppable force of Wall St corruption meets the immovable object of Patrick Stars that just buy and hold, no matter green or red dildos.

>	This is how the market SHOULD work.

‚ÄúShould‚Äù went out the door with manipulation and naked shorting. 

It went out the door with the doubling down (or worse) by the bad actors and the spending over a year of nonstop media bashing and utter nonfeasance on behalf of the government to try to get retail to sell. It went out the door with changing the rules as they went, with moving to swaps and having the CFTC conveniently hide swaps data until Oct. 2023.

‚ÄúShould‚Äù went out the door when retail stopped acting rational. When it went Neo and began to believe. When people diamond hand this stock no matter where it goes, up 50% or down 50%. When people just buy more and hold.

As that Houston Wade guy said a year ago: ‚Äúit‚Äôs art of war mastery by a bunch of idiots.‚Äù",851,u6pp8i,2022-04-19T01:28:03Z,2022-04-19

2002,gme,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.,"Efficient market hypothesis is a cope designed by economists who can't model human behavior or tell the future. It's total nonsense and always has been. Assets are regularly mispriced to both the upside and downside. If you can keep your head and manage your own psychology you can profit from the volitility. You buy when the market hates an asset and sell when the market changes its mind. Take current Warren Buffett favorite OXY as an example. In 2020 the price was 20 bucks and he got a dividend paid in shares. He sold them immediately. That looked smart in the short term as the stock went down to 8 dollars that year. Today a year and a half later and the stock is at 62 bucks and ole uncle Warren rebought the shares he sold at 20 when it was between 40 to 60. Literally no one, not even the best capitalist of all time can tell the future which is why the efficient market nonsense doesn't work. I on the other hand bought OXY at 10.50 average because I know the oil industry well and knew the stock was badly mispriced. Stick to things you know and you can profit from trading with emotional people who don't understand what they are buying.

2003,gme,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.,"It's really not that complicated. GameStop is a retail-backed start-up with a legacy business attached. The ""analysts"" are ragging on it for its legacy business but the market is evaluating it based on its potential, much to the dismay of short sellers who loaded up their positons back when GameStop *was* arguably a ""dying brick and mortar"". 

The ensuing short squeeze WILL be the mother of all short squeezes, though how high it goes is anyone's guess. And it will happen when the rest of the market realizes they were consuming bad information about the stock.

An essential component to an efficient market is the rapid dissemination of reliable information. Financial reporting has been hijacked by interest groups who control the information that market participants have access to. And as a result it has caused distortions.

So if you think the valuation doesn't make any sense, then you're looking at it wrong.",147,u6pp8i,2022-04-19T00:53:54Z,2022-04-19

I'm currently at Booth where the EMH was invented and popularized, and even here nobody thinks EMH is 100% accurate.

Also, I don't think your post is about the EMH as much as models like CAPM. GME's rise is actually pretty explicable within the context of traditional economics, just the incentives are weird: people seem to derive huge utility from buying and holding GME.

If you look at GME price action over the last year and a half, it isn't normal, it never got back to normal. This thing can move 50% in a few days on no news. Sure the media will say ""GME is up on renewed retail interest"" or equate it to some other dumb reason that is far detached from realty, but you got to be dull to think we have any sway. It isn't like everyone decides to buy on the same day, at the same time. Even if we did, it would all be routed into dark pools, which by the way, are meant for institutional orders to suppress the effect on price when they buy-in. What do you get when sometimes up to 90% of retail order flow is routed off lit-exchanges? Distortion. True price discovery is dead when they cut demand and inflate supply. 

Yet there are still so many who genuinely believe in, and even defend these financial institutions. They say they didn't lie, that they can't do what is being theorised.

In fact a decent argument could be made that these sort of things have the opposite of the intended effect. Either people think it's a huge enough deal that everyone else will handle it, or just go with a hard eye roll because someone is telling them what to do.

Why is someone unwilling to show their positions telling GME investors what to do?,"Calls to action are something that came up last year shortly after the sec gamestop report. If I remember correctly it was something about anonymously reporting the illegal naked shorting and market manipulation to the sec so they were forced to forward it to the doj. Can't find the post, must be deleted. Seeing all those new actions taken by apes I am happy because we are beginning to stand up and raise our voices in a fashion that uses our power in numbers in such a way to force change from within the system. 
Try to look at it this way: those shf and their lawyers never dared to dream about the nightmare we are for their entire system of crime because we learned to use their own system against them while creating more and more pressure with drs and attracting great minds like dlauer, pulte and so on for our great cause.
Their entire mindset was that apes are stupid and crazy but apes proofed that retail is more powerful and smart than their entire network of crime and manipulation can ever be when showed the right direction. Apes already began remodeling the market and system and with moass apes will rebuild it and monitor i5 as it should have been from the get go. One ape showed a tool to the other apes, it worked, and is being refined and used as time goes on. First we learned to buy, then hodl, then we learned to drs, and now we learned how to use the same power that made the tools mentioned before so incredible powerful to complain and shape the rules for a better and fairer market.

‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Apes with money tied up in other investments could convert those to GME and DRS.

‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Apes with shares in brokers that will not DRS, such as Etoro and T212 : think about selling and re-buying elsewhere!! They don‚Äôt have shares anyway, so selling hurts nothing.

2709,gme,GME,POST,Researching .com squeezes and guess with? nothing on the web!! Relatable to GME proably,"Preface:
So I was considering what is going to be my next long play/plays after GME inevitably moons and we are all filthy rich üí¶

Considering how inflation is here to stay. Me as an simple smooth brained ape gravitated towards alternative energy solutions. 

I try to keep things simple, it‚Äôs easier to process due to lack wrinkles, my theory is that the 2000‚Äôs were simply times were fuel prices were low, thus shorts took a interest in shorting a company working towards cleaner energy such Hydrogen Fuel Cell.

Conclusion: Came across Ticker FCEL (Fuel Cell Energy) simple look at the charts reveal that on October 2nd, 2000 ( Possibly shorts covering from the DOT COM bubble) the stock rose to ATH $7421.94. Shows similar pre-sneeze price moment as GME back in January. 

But there is literally nothing on this on the internet, but I managed to scrap something quite interesting that might be relatable to GME considering the current hype for a Split/Dividend. 

[FCEL Split History](https://m.splithistory.com/fcel/)

Now my fellow retards it is a coincidence that a 2:1 split was done on 09/14/2000 before the stock the rallying to $7421.94 about 16 days later on Oct 2nd‚Ä¶..I think not üëÄ

2723,gme,GME,COMMENT,Smooth brain doesn't maff gud. Buy more GME now or wait for the split?,"Let‚Äôs assume that the share split dividend is a 7 to 1 split. So for every share you own before the dividend date, you‚Äôll receive 6 more. So if the share price stays the same from now until the dividend, then you‚Äôre getting the same exact amount of shares for your money if you buy now or after.

So if you wait till after the split-dividend, yes you‚Äôre technically buying more shares, but you‚Äôre still getting the same bang for your buck by buying before the dividend (assuming price stays the same).

I‚Äôm a firm believer that the stock split-dividend will raise the cost per share by causing a wave of retail buying due to the more affordable price. I also believe that the stock split-dividend will be the catalyst for MOASS.

This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want with your money, my only hope is that you make an informed decision.

Just for example. Let's say price is 200 pre-split and splits to 50 after. 1000 invested pre-split gets you 5 shares that split to 20. 1000 invested post-split gets you 20.

here is the thing. this might take up either way a whole working week. currently i am in the red my BEP is around 170 usd. should i wait for bep and then sell? or risk losing money in the process? what is the best and fastest way i can get to Computershare,  NOTE i already have 2 shares @ Computershare. so i dont need to do the ikbr thing.",4,u6569h,2022-04-18T17:20:12Z,2022-04-18

2843,gme,GME,POST,"Trying to buy and DRS GME but as a Canadian I'm not sure what the most ""efficient"" Method is?","I'm pretty new to this and every time I learn something new I feel like I get more confused haha. Finished setting up an IBKR account and was gonna get some GME, however I read that you should DSR your shares to help encourage the short-squeeeeze. [DSRGME.org](https://DSRGME.org) doesn't have instructions for transferring from IBKR so thought buying directly from computershare might be better but I have to jump through some hoops. (setting up [wise.com](https://wise.com) for US bank account, or use Giveashare)

If i were to go the [wise.com](https://wise.com) route, do they charge a lot for the currency conversion from CAD to USD? And is the ComputerShare "" $5 fee per individual investment, and $2.50 for recurring "" per stock or per transaction?(assuming first time is $5 and subsequent purchases of the same stock are $2.50 each?)

If I were to go the GiveaShare route: ""The cost is an extra $50-100 on top of the share price"", Is that per stock or per transaction?  

I plan on doing a lump sum off the bat (Only a few grand as I wasn't as fiscally responsible in my younger years), and then adding some every paycheque/month. Just wondering if any other Canadians have any tips, guidance, or if this is even worth it. Thanks for reading :)",36,u635ki,2022-04-18T03:01:33Z,2022-04-18

2848,gme,GME,COMMENT,"Trying to buy and DRS GME but as a Canadian I'm not sure what the most ""efficient"" Method is?","I would go with the [wise.com](https://wise.com) route. The conversion fee isn't too significant, and you wouldn't need to go through a broker. 

My personal experience was I had to DRS at least one share to create an account on Computershare, but that was before I found out I could have made a US account through wise. I believe you can bypass the broker if you just buy straight from Computershare using a US bank account. You'll have to fill out some tax forms that you should be prompted by Computershare to complete.

The fees for one time and recurring investments are charged per transaction, not per share.",2,u635ki,2022-04-18T10:06:11Z,2022-04-18
2849,gme,GME,COMMENT,"Trying to buy and DRS GME but as a Canadian I'm not sure what the most ""efficient"" Method is?","If you buy through computer share using wise or whatever it's a market order.


If you buy through a bank and drs its a $5 - $300 fee depending on which one per transaction (for any amount of shares).


You have to make that decision.

And why would creating new rules within a corrupt system work to stop the MOASS when there‚Äôs already a likely plan to take GameStop out of the corrupt system in the first place; forcing shorts to close their short positions whether they like it or not?

We have had plenty of phases where people ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù rules that would end MOASS; ‚Äúbail-ins‚Äù, forever FTD‚Äôs and trading halts, ComputerShare limit sells at $200K, etc.

All have ended the same. People thought about them, realized they were faulty arguments when the finer details were left out by the people(s) who brought them forward and when considered made their arguments invalid, and we all moved on.

The thing about manipulators is that they will always use the exact same tactics to manipulate their victims; it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs on the surface that changes. 

This is no different.

Just another scare tactic to get us divided under a different mask.",72,u87nko,2022-04-20T21:58:08Z,2022-04-20

3003,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,All users with year old accounts and words like ‚Äústonk‚Äù ‚Äúape‚Äù ‚ÄúGME‚Äù or any lingo in the username should be highly scrutinized.,">More than half of every account I inspect is around a year old.

That's definately around the time when a bunch of people jumped on after they were pumped up about how nontraditional investors/DFV mooned GME.  It would make sense to see a bunch of 15-9 month old accounts.  I say 9 because for some people it took a while and GME was shown to not be a late Jan everyone held backs story like the MSM pushed. 

The resurgence in early march brought killed that notion to sensible people very quick - Feb 19 to March 12th had a straight climb up from 40s - only that time it didnt liquidate off and held a floor of about 156 only to go up to  248 in early june and slightly lower climb in Nov.  Looking at the steady late feb-early march buildup I can imagine a lot of people were piling in , and making their accounts in this period,  which would be about a year - I would guess even more than the initial climb in Jan.  

There's definately some suspicious ones ive seen in replies - and im certain a lot of people have bots for the reason your talking about - some probably to just spam people to try to grow their business or whatever, ive definately gotten a slew of DMs with names like you specified  HODLAPE and shit like that.  But i would think an account that is 1 year old (probably 13-14 months) is unusual given the steady build of loyal investors in that march climb.  I was really crazy about everything in that time bc ever day it was up more and more - I had like genuine pride and excitement bc of what it symbolized to.  I got on in february and before that I put money in ETFs every quarterly bonus and rarely paid attention to what was going on.  

February-march-april were three months that definately changed most of what I do and since then its stuck,  felt a little bit of that a month ago which only strengthened my resolve.  But those months in 2021 definately brought a lot of new retail investors to the table, and the infiltrators/manipulators with them.  It would be hard to use the date range of around a year as a red flag given that both types of users grew at the same time.",3,u84ror,2022-04-20T20:14:15Z,2022-04-20

3272,gme,Superstonk,POST,If you are a HF and are naked short on GME at a ratio of say 11:1 and then a vote for a 7:1 stock split dividend is announced do you now need to buy 7x11=77 calls for every FTD you are hiding to kick the can?,"I'm a smooth, so forgive me.

I mean, it's one thing if you are short 1:1 and just need to buy 7 to sell (edit, give actually) to someone who needs to hand out a dividend.  But if you are naked short, can't locate shares, and need to just make some imaginary ones, you gotta buy the 77 calls to pretend you will acquire them right?

So every FTD = 77 calls for this HF in this example?",57,u7v8wa,2022-04-20T12:21:48Z,2022-04-20

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",2270,u7qj81,2022-04-20T07:00:10Z,2022-04-20

TLDR: GME dividend split is similar to Tesla who did the same type of split. Tesla was  reported 7.10% SI to float and a 0.30% borrowing fee. GameStop's reported SI and borrowing fees are  reported short interest is at 22.21%. Cost to borrow 8.72%.  
but don't forget shorts never covered, the SEC said so, and Jan 2021 it was what, 221% short?   Hedges are fukt

Good doc about the flash crash where over a trillion was lost in market caps in about 10 min.

A guy got sick of algos beating him on trades and created his own. It worked so well that other algos were taking his into consideration when creating their output. Then he turned his off one day for w/e reason and the output from their algos turned into sell sell sell.

Shows you how algo trading/hft is one giant interdependent organism.

To Whom It May Concern,


As a citizen of the United States of America and as a retail investor, it is my understanding that it is the job of the SEC to protect investors, and maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets. 

Today I am writing about SR-NSCC-2022-003 and to express my opposition towards it. This bill completely favors large institutional investors at the cost of retail. The current market is already rife with abusive naked short selling, PFOF, FTD manipulation through derivatives and dark pool order routing for retail order flow. All of which prevents accurate price discovery.  This proposed rule change would allow institutional players more freedoms to continue with these malicious practices. This benefits the big players at the cost of the retail investor.

My faith in the free and efficient markets of the United States and in the SEC will be forever damaged if the SEC turns a blind eye to the plight of retail investors in favor of the institutions and their lobbyists. 

As someone who has served (and continues to serve) this country in the armed forces I implore you to now serve the people of this country and do your job and protect retail investors. Show us that the free market is not just an illusion. 

Thank you for your time",12,u7qj81,2022-04-20T16:44:54Z,2022-04-20

I truly believe that they are using drops and runs as a means of distraction.  My new hypothesis:  Major key players shorting GME are utilizing the share price action as a means to distraction; in which, Ryan Cohen is informing us of important filings through his tweets.

\*\*Update:\*\*Please read my recent post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u58o6s/new_proposed_rule_13f2_comment_closes_april_26/)).  Overall in that post, I basically find correlation that specific SEC filings/comment will ramp and/or dramatically drop as a possible means of distraction.  I provide dates of SEC proposals compared to beginning dates of the start of a dramatic run or decline.  I am providing an update primarily because when I saw Cohen's tweet this morning including a SEC proposal (a very important one: ~~Short Position and Short Activity Reporting by Institutional Investment Managers~~  ***Securities Finance Transactions \[Edit 4/20/22 11:12am pacific\])***, I predicted that we would either have a very dramatic drop or ramping up-tick in GME.   My prediction was correct.  I do find correlation between Ryan Cohen's tweet, SEC proposals, and GME share price.   ***My new hypothesis:***  Major key players shorting GME are utilizing the share price action as a means to distraction; in which, Ryan Cohen is informing us of important filings through his tweets.

&#x200B;

**March 2nd was a decline up until March 15th (evidence in my previous post).   Starting from March 16th, a SEC proposal was announced.  I looked back and found that Ryan Cohen tweeted on March 2nd intraday and March 14th+15th.  Below are screenshots.**

&#x200B;

**Then on April 18th, Ryan Cohen tweets where the following morning, the SEC releases a very important proposal on April 19th:  Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)**

**Limitations:**  Again, if you read my previous post, you are very well aware of my listed limitations so I will be adding on.  Overall, I need more data sets to strengthen my research.  Moving forward, I will be collecting Ryan Cohen's tweets and cross-referencing with any released SEC filings, proposals, and/or notices in regards to any of the regulatory organizations.  I do not have much time to pull past Federal Register and sift through it because I work Full-Time + OT as it would take too much of my time to do so and I need my sleep.  If anyone wants to help, please do so if you have free time. You can reach out to me by DM.  If not, I'll just keep moving forward.  Another limitation is that I am unsure what Ryan Cohen is trying to tell us.

**Conclusion:**  I do find correlation between GME's aggressive up-tick/down-tick in regards to SEC's proposals, filings, and/or notices.  If anything, Ryan Cohen's tweet has strengthened my findings in regards to evidence of cross-referencing dates.   Remember, please comment on the 240.13F-2 (Proposed Rule 13F-2 Short Selling Transparency) as well.  I get it that people want to focus on the NSCC SFT, but these two are important as a whole.

**EDIT 1 04/19/22 10:50pm pacific:**

Here are additional correlation comparisons for yall on Feb 8-9 and Feb 24-25 with Ryan Cohen's tweet.  This one will be confusing but they all circulate around the same time.  The weird part is: the dates are all mixed and the published documents were not being updated properly as they should be such as on the Federal Register or Proposal Commenting Page.  Even the dates are all skewed.  For example, Shortening the Securities Transactions Settlement Cycle was released on Feb 9th but posted on Federal Register on Feb 24th (weird huh?).  Guess what? Both dates ran.  However, those dates within that same week had VERY important filings:  Short selling transparency, shortening settlement cycle, and reporting of SECURITIES LOANS (sound familiar?).   Again, this strengthens my hypothesis.

**Edit 2 4/19/22 11:25pm:**

My response to another redditor:  I should also note that their filings that has to do with mitigating risk began late last year to present moment. I truly believe that they thought they could shake off retail last year, failed, and now realized how truly fucked they are.

Check this: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/proposedarchive/proposed2021.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/proposedarchive/proposed2021.shtml)

If you look in 2021, starting from around November, they started to take their filings seriously. If you look back at 2020, there is literally NOTHING that has to do with market risks.  Now look at 2022 1st quarter... massive filings.  Is this a coincidence?  I am not sure.  Again, I could be VERY VERY VERY wrong.  Please take it with a grain of salt as this is just a working theory.  I do not want to mislead anyone.",606,u7o0ik,2022-04-20T04:14:58Z,2022-04-20

4131,gme,Superstonk,POST,Anyone else having problems with the Computershare GME dedicated number?,"So  before last week i called to ask for the courier service for my first letter of my DRS transfer from hatch NZ. All good still waiting but is coming with courier. And i tried to call this week to ask for the same service for my other account i purchase DRS through giveashare but when i cal CS GME dedicsted number is saying lines are closed and call between 830 am and 530 pm but the thing is it says that even when i call at those hours. I call another number not dedicated to GME from computershare but i didnt get any info as to why the number is doing that. Apparently my give ashare (purchase april 16) still not there but i would prefer to talk someone on the GME dedicsted number since they seem to handle requests more effi ie tly than regular computershare operstors. Any idea how long takes give a share to DRS? And how to make the first letter pain easier?

I'm trying to gather data on rationally explaining the motive behind everything we've found.  It's one thing to point to reddit and say ""look at how many people are here"" and then the price of GME and another to logically express it.

The more people I get to respond to these two questions, the more accurate I can establish a model given the overall population for the sub.

The GME trade in my view is a game of chicken. It's a bluff. It's a standoff. It's a slow bleed of the wills.

Just on the same train of thought, the Sec gets up to date FTD data but reports it 2 weeks later. They showed this when they reported the data on time in error and then reported the same data 2 weeks later

There was evidence posted that the short position was 226% in January. Tied in with the fact that institutions apparently owned over 100% of the float alone shows the sheer scale of what's been going on.",3,u7fe9u,2022-04-19T22:13:59Z,2022-04-19

4190,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What do you think the realized short-interest rate of GME is?,"Given the prior Tesla run and Elon musk saying Tesla was the most shorted stock in history at like 20% reported, I don't believe game stops short interest at all.  Even before Elon I called bs which is why I held and bought more.  When the sec report came saying it wasn't covering that was confirmation for me.  Elon is the nail in the coffin, what would the man care currently hes like a multi billionaire, possibly soon to be trillionaire, with tons of important things to do than go on a show and say things that weren't true and not important.

They probably figured out how to manipulate short interest already during the Tesla run.  If they could do it to Tesla why not gme?

A part of me thinks the reason it's taking so long is the amount of tricks they probably figured out from the Tesla run.  This isn't their first rodeo...

# Part 1:  Understanding the players.

**The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)** is an American financial services company, owned by Banks and Brokers, that provides clearing and settlement services for the financial markets.  

T**he National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)** is a subsidiary of the DTCC.   The NSCC operates as a seller for every buyer, and buyer for every seller in the financial industry for trades that settle in U.S. markets.

**The Continuous Net Settlement (CNS)** System is NSCC‚Äôs core netting, allotting and fail-control engine. It is an automated accounting system that centralizes settlement and maintains an orderly flow of security and money balances.  Within CNS, each security is netted to one position per Member, with NSCC as its central counterparty. Within CNS, NSCC acts as the central counterparty for clearance and settlement for virtually all broker-to-broker equity, corporate and municipal bond and unit investment trust trading in the United States. 

CNS settles trades from the nation's major exchanges, markets and other sources and nets these transactions to one security position per Member per day. Cash dividends, stock dividends, bond interest, and mandatory corporate actions are automatically debited or credited to Members' CNS accounts with open fail positions. On settlement date, all trades due to settle are netted by issue to a *net long* (buy) or a *net short* (sell) position,

**Cede and Company**, also known as ""Cede and Co."" or ""Cede & Co."" (shorthand for ""certificate depository""), by Nasdaq definition, is the Nominee name for DTCC - a large clearing house that holds shares in its name for banks, brokers and institutions in order to expedite the sale and transfer of stock.  Cede and Co is a specialist United States financial institution that processes transfers of stock certificates on behalf of the DTCC.  Cede technically owns substantially all of the publicly issued stock in the United States. Thus, investors do not themselves hold direct property rights in stock, but rather have contractual rights that are part of a chain of contractual rights involving Cede. *\[*[*https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvspq/cede\_co\_the\_secret\_trilliondollar\_company\_that/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvspq/cede_co_the_secret_trilliondollar_company_that/)*\]*

**Brokers:**  A prime brokerage (PB) is investment banks and other financial institutions that offer a bundled group of services to hedge funds and other large investment clients that need to be able to borrow securities or cash.  A broker-dealer (BD) is a person or firm in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers. The term broker-dealer is used in U.S. securities regulation parlance to describe stock brokerages because most of them act as both agents and principals. 
  

  
A brokerage acts as a broker (or agent) when it executes orders on behalf of its clients, whereas it acts as a dealer, or principal when it trades for its own account.  The services provided under prime brokering include securities lending, leveraged trade execution, and cash management, among other things. Prime brokerage services are provided by most of the largest financial services firms, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Morgan Stanley.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: What happens with the stock dividend distribution for GameStop's stock split?:

When a company declares a stock dividend the information is generally provided to DTC by the security‚Äôs issuer (GameStop) or agent (ComputerShare) in the form of an event announcement. This information is then sent to all clients of DTC‚Äôs Corporate Action Service (Brokers).
  

  
When it is time for the stock dividends to be allocated, all entitled holders at DTC are sent confirmations communicating information associated with the dividend event. The message can feed directly into a client‚Äôs system (eg. Brokers) so that they can pay their holders (eg. Non DRS Apes) and perform their reconciliation process as soon as their account at DTC has been funded.
  

  
The DTC is the ultimate 'record keeper' of the legitimate shareholders brokers have registered as holding GME in street name with Cede and Co. When GameStop / Computershare sends the confirmation of issued shares, the DTC facilitates the distribution of these shares for record holders and manages the Broker reconciliation. All shareholders not short the stock are entitled to the GME share split stock dividends.  
  

  
DD supports GME is heavily shorted, as well as having significant counterfeit shares hidden through manipulative derivative strategies.  Shareholders that bought these shorted and counterfeited shares *are legitimate owners* of the stock, and are entitled to the stock split share dividends.  However GameStop will not issue enough stock dividends for these positions - and it is the Brokers that hold the ultimate obligation for the stock split share dividends for their eligible shareholder clients.  At this time it remains unclear as to whether the DTC initially issues enough shares for all eligible nominee accounts to the Brokers and then *works behind the scenes for reconciliation with the brokers* \- or on the stock split distribution date, will some Brokers based on their net settlement balance receive an insufficient amount of shares / shortfall on the amount of shares required for distribution to their clients?  

Market participants who have borrowed and sold shares short are responsible for those additional/missing stock dividends, and will be on the hook to close their positions and make restitution to the Lender / Broker they borrowed from (in this circumstance this might be in cash or stock, but the end-game result is that at some point one of the participants actually needs to go to the market and actually purchase the shares to close the position). Same applies with bag holders from the sale of the counterfeit shares that are now held by clients in a Broker account.  


Addressing the Speculation:  If the DTC does not allocate enough shares for the stock split to Brokers by the stock split distribution date, some of the more nefarious brokers will have over-extended themselves and due to lending / shorting GME may be in a position of being unable to procure enough shares for their eligible shareholders.  In certain circumstances, some Brokers may have the option to payout in cash in lieu of stock on a declared dividend.  However, clarification needs to be made on whether this option actually pertains to a stock splits or only to declared dividends and not stock split allocations (Will the DTC allocate enough shares for the stock split and later reconcile short positions direct with the Broker?).

Note:  *For Tesla, we have not seen any reference to shares not being delivered*, or cash in lieu of stock awarded.  Tesla's squeeze happened over *several* months after the ex-dividend date, so I would assume the shares / shorts that were created from the legal shorts and counterfeits were being *reconciled behind the scenes* and closed during this period (or at least some of them). \[Remember, Tesla also had high short interest that declined without share price appreciation the year prior to their stock split, only to squeeze a year later with their stock split in the form of a stock dividend\].

IMO financially stable brokers would not want the reputational risk etcetera of not delivering shares.  However, in a worse case scenario, if a shareholder is allocated cash in lieu of GME shares, the shareholder could then buy GME with the cash equivalent (with negative tax consequences to having received the share dividend).  
  

  

*Stock splits (in the form of stock dividends) are not the same thing as declared dividends.  \[Please see my profile pinned post '**It's a stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) - not a declared dividend. Taking a look at what this means; Along with a look at charts from Overstock's digital dividend and the stock splits by form of a stock dividend for NVIDIA & TESLA**'\]:*


Interactive Brokers (IB):  To summarize, if by the record date of a dividend certain shares have not been delivered to IB, the Firm will be paid an amount of cash *t*hat is equivalent to the dividend amount  \[note: this happens when shares are leant out and the borrower provides restitution in cash instead of returning the share\], but IB will not receive a qualified dividend payment directly from the issuer. In such cases, the Firm will receive payment in lieu (PIL) and will have no choice but to allocate such payment in lieu to customer accounts. The firm first allocates PIL to those accounts who hold the shares as collateral for a margin loan. If, after PIL is allocated to all shareholders whose accounts are not fully paid, any portion of PIL remains to be paid, it is allocated on a pro-rata basis to each remaining client account.

# Part 3:  For those questioning whether market participants short this stock can just borrow more to cover or counterfeit more shares to prevent the price appreciation and squeeze.

&#x200B;

>(i) Keep in mind the current reported SI, lack of $GME liquidity, high borrowing costs and margin requirements.    
>  
>(ii) Consider the amount of counterfeit or synthetic shares that DD supports exists and is hidden through manipulative derivative strategies.

If the borrowed short positions and the counterfeit shares aren't covered prior to the ex-dividend date, GameStop will only issue a specific number of shares to the DTCC based on the split ratio to be distributed to shareholders. Assuming 7:1, they are issuing an additional 6 shares for every legitimate share owned. Multiply all of the legitimate shorts and more importantly the counterfeit shorts by a factor of 7. We are likely talking billions of shares that need to be procured overnight.

We are already at 100% utilization of shares available to borrow by lender (at a significant cost to the shorts). The stock split does not increase this amount available on the already leant out shares. Where and how will the additional, potentially billions, of shares to borrow come from?

GameStop's recent 10k shows the weighted averaged diluted Common Shares outstanding for GME at 72.6 million. Less: Institutional Unknown: 28,413,271 \[includes illiquid Mutual Funds & Pensions: 8,004,284, ETFs: 6,588,016\], Insider: 12,716,820, Shareholder DRS total: 8,900,000. This represents a remaining tradeable float of only approximately 22.5 million shares. \[Note this is a bit dated - pulled it from a prior post of mine\].

There just isn't enough shares in the system available to make this happen - too much volume to control. Plus consider the margin requirements to borrow this many shares. This stock will be under a microscope by apes and others, and the illegal creation of outright counterfeit shares in this volume would be traceable and well documented for court litigation - of which most prime brokers-dealers would outright avoid at the sake of (including but not limited to) reputational risk, potential jail terms and revocation/banning of future trading. There are simply too many shares to 'poof into existence'. Look at how the internalization of shares got away from them back in the Jan '21 'sneeze squeeze'.

Plus, there is a high probability that the lower share cost after the split will result in some FOMO. Options will be cheaper to purchase and exercise, and at least some covering of shorts is probable. Market participants short the stock are just digging a deeper and deeper, more costly, hole to bury themselves in.

I believe the Tesla stock split by form of stock dividend in August 2020 is a great comparison for GME. They had high short interest that miraculously declined without real appreciation of the stock price. After the share dividend, they squeezed - huge. GME has less outstanding shares, but less liquidity, and DD supports an extensively higher hidden SI. Apes have DRS their shares, and the liquid shares available to trade are miniscule.

Plus, IMP, I am a firm believer that RC / Gamestop have a secondary plan to eradicate the shorts. It may take some time, but as a follow up to the stock split I think there is a high probability that some type of crypto / NFT unit|dividend|token / digital dividend / spin-off related to their Marketplace will happen. 

'Checkmate!'

# Part 4:  A look at Tesla's stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) as a comparable for GameStop.

Short interest and borrowing fees on Tesla were considered high at a reported 7.10% SI to float and a 0.30% borrowing fee. Note GameStop's *reported* SI and borrowing fees are *extensively* higher. Current Ortex data shows GameStop reported short interest is at 22.21%. Cost to borrow 8.72%.

&#x200B;

[Tesla's 5:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Announced August 11, 2020. Record date August 21, 2020. Ex-dividend date August 31, 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/k6vgsny1piu81.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49b109e648eb997a21f255bca5cec39d5bb023a)

Note, similar to GameStop, Tesla's short interest declined without share price appreciation the year prior to their stock split. After the dividend distribution, Tesla's shares squeezed over a period of several months. GME has less outstanding shares, but less liquidity, higher borrowing rates, higher margin requirements, and as DD supports - an extensively higher hidden short interest.

Tesla's reported short interest hit a May 2019 high of *only 43.66 million* shares shorted. GameStop had reported short interest of *over* *200 million* by FINRA report - [309.43% SI in October 202](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u2ylh7/never_forget_gamestops_short_interest_in_october/i4q9ep7/?context=3)0 and 220%+ during January 2021 'sneeze squeeze' (court docs).

4251,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,How will GameStop's stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) work? Will the stock split cause GME to squeeze? A look at Tesla's stock split as a comparable for GameStop.,"I used to compare GME with TSLA in regards to the split ‚Äúin the form of a dividend‚Äù

But the difference between GME and TSLA is:
- TSLA wasn‚Äôt as shorted, so the losses for SHF‚Äôs to buy back and close positions were most likely not a catastrophic, **idiosyncratic** risk to the broad market. 
- GME is so shorted that it will literally break the market if the price rises too high and too fast. It is the one **idiosyncratic** risk to the entire financial system. 

Therefore: 
- It is in the best interest of the brokerages to **not** margin call/liquidate SHF‚Äôs and to possibly fake & internalize the split/dividend. It‚Äôll be similar to buying shares or crypto on Robbinghood. You don‚Äôt own the shares or crypto, but they‚Äôll just show you the correct balance based on how much you paid for. 
- for the same reason, it is also not in the best interest for DTC to liquidate Brokerages.

- As long as there are shares on the DTC system, the DTC, brokerages, and SHF‚Äôs can all collude to internalize everything.
- What that means is they will do everything they possibly can to either keep GME price suppressed, or increase their total collateral on their other assets by pumping the entire market. For anyone paying attention to the correlation of GME‚Äôs price and the S&P500, you would have noticed that They‚Äôve been doing exactly this for months now. 

The only solutions I see are:
- DRS **all shares** away from DTC.
- GameStop decides to manually recall all shares off the DTC system and onto their own blockchain/NFT platform.",67,u7blcg,2022-04-19T21:40:20Z,2022-04-19

A look at Tesla's stock split as a comparable for GameStop.,"The IBKR link you provided does not seem applicable as it pertains to an **ordinary dividend** which is defined as:

>	An ordinary dividend is a regularly scheduled payment made by a company to its shareholders. Dividends are the portion of a company's earnings not reinvested in the business, but paid out to investors as ordinary dividends, special dividends, or stock dividends.

A split dividend is not an ordinary dividend and I honestly feel any post normalizing receiving cash instead of shares is low key FUD.  If they can afford to pay cash for the shares then they can afford to buy them from the market.

Also, the IBKR link goes on to say that cash paid shares are required to be held segregated from shares purchased in a margin account:

>	**Payment in lieu of an ordinary dividend may be received when the shares have been bought on margin**, or **when the account has a subsequent margin loan due to borrowing money to facilitate the payment for additional purchases of shares or as the result of a withdrawal from the margin account**. Payment in lieu of a dividend may also be received when shares are owed to the brokerage firm and have not been received by the dividend record date.

>	To better understand the difference between an ordinary dividend and a payment in lieu, we will explain the steps taken by IB to comply with US regulations. Each business day, the Firm analyzes the positions in each customer account, every borrow, every loan, every pledge of shares for each security held by its customers to determine how many shares are held on margin and the associated margin loan balances. **For each security that is fully paid, we are required to segregate those shares in a good control location** (for example, a depository or a US bank. See KB1964).  **For shares that are held as collateral for a margin loan we are allowed to hypothecate and re-hypothecate shares valued up to 140 percent of the total debit balance in the customer account** (See KB1967).

Ensure your account is a cash account and you‚Äôre not on margin.  Since cash shares are segregated and ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt lend them‚Äô(they swear!) **you should in not receive ‚Äòcash in lieu‚Äô** and should not settle for cash instead of shares either IMO.",10,u7blcg,2022-04-19T20:13:58Z,2022-04-19

If you split a stock then the option gets split too, but with them being dividends I would expect nothing to happen to the options. e.g. you own a call for 1/1/2023 and then dividend is one share and I would figure you would still own just a single call for 1/1/2023.

Serious props.  

I read this post intently.  I've been on the share dividend ever since last year.   I got put down due to shills (most def) and fog-of-war over what kind of dividend might smash shorts - cash, share or NFT.   NFT got ejaculated into sub and has stuck around right the Great Crypto Pump of last summer until recently.   All is fair, bigons.   I didn't (and probably still don't) completely understand how a share dividend works best, but my gut has always been that it is, and because it works with all the established precedent and existing rules very well.   

Anyways, the fuckey with Tesla and the beginning of weaponized autism on the OG sub showed me that the curtain was being pulled back and I started to understand better and started saving to try my luck at the casino for myself.  

Point is, thanks.   


This was really, really well written and something I wanted to explore on my own, using Tesla as an analogue.   Truth be told, I was having a hard time trying to figure out where to start with it.  

You laid it all out well, confirms my bias (hah), and presented it simply.   Also, you give people like me a way to see where to start in getting the right information to do their own dirty work.  

I still think there are a few curve balls with all the rule changes that have happened over the year, but I think this is the general direction. 

People like you make this sub great.  Thanks.",2,u7blcg,2022-04-20T07:01:18Z,2022-04-20

Top work OP.

Please keep addressing these lingering uncertainties as new info emerges.

Regarding 'poofing' more shares into existence, AFAIK, all the methods they use to naked short involve *someone, somewhere* being on the other end of a *transaction*. They may be able to mark shares as ""sold not yet purchased"" but I don't think they have a column in the accounts for ""printed from thin air because whatever"".

Distributing shares in the form of a dividend is not a *transaction*, we are not buying them, they are not selling them, all that is **supposed** to be happening is a game of pass the parcel.

Any such magic creation of new shares by the DTCC or Brokers or MMs would need to eventually appear on some set of books as some sort of *liability*, unless we have finally *actually* moved into a completely fraudulent system.",1,u7blcg,2022-04-20T00:04:40Z,2022-04-20

No stock dividend but here‚Äôs cash instead you pay the taxes ?

So someone owns 10k for easy maths $10,000 x 7 =$70k. Investors pay short term gains 33% on 2022 tax forms .
So a loss of what $22,000.00 ? with no fault by us ?

Now if we held awarded shares never to be sold or when we chose to sell ? Then TAX will be paid , our choice not there‚Äôs?

4344,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,"GME now the top-weighted stock held by XRT. Used to barely crack the top 20. Means nothing, though, amirite?","Hmmm ü§î

ETF channel is saying XRT has a market cap of 540 mil, but 1.17% of that is $6.3 mil not the $2.9 mil shown in this post.

That discrepancy is odd enough, but also, I checked how much GME was in XRT a week ago, it was 55,000

This new weighting does not make sense to me, it seems like there is less GME now, as $6.3 mil would only equate to 42,000 shares

GME has probably had more significant gains than other stocks held in the etf. This brings the weight % up.

4407,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,GME Short Interest 20.43% changed by +0.48% for 4/18/22 - Ortex,"Ortex describes ""Utilization"" as follows:  
The ratio between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs; 100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent. Unless otherwise specified, this is given in decimal format.",9,u7612w,2022-04-19T14:08:35Z,2022-04-19

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",2339,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T07:00:11Z,2022-04-19

4496,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"So what happened this morning?

- the entire Market ripped upward while GME was being suppressed downward at Market Open
- Why? Because SHF‚Äôs know the price of GME needs to go up today for whatever reason (FTD cycles? Not sure. Something RC knows the timing of, hence last night‚Äôs tweet) 
- I‚Äôve been saying for months now that SHF‚Äôs hedge against GME by utilizing the entire market‚Äôs movement. 
- If SHF‚Äôs are anticipating an upward price movement on GME, they **need** to pump the market first.
- Why? Because SHF‚Äôs shorted GME, every time GME goes up, the short position gets larger and larger. This means their balance becomes more negative. The only way to prove to their lenders that they can pay off the short position is to show that they have enough collateral.
- What collateral? Their long positions on other stocks. 
- So if GME goes up, You bet they will pump the market to stay solvent.
- what about a Marketwide selloff? Well then their collateral shrinks. They would **need** to bring GME down with the market


They will do this indefinitely until they can‚Äôt. As long as they have DTC shares to manipulate with, they are in control.

#DRS is the only way out.

I subscribed to Netflix because I was tired of getting hit by late fees from Blockbuster for returning the disk after 12:00 PM. Then they added streaming, which was a bonus.

I don‚Äôt require DVDs in the mail anymore. But you know what‚Äôs missing from my Netflix subscription now that I don‚Äôt get them? The ability to watch popular films shortly after their release in the theater. I almost always have to use another service for that.

Netflix isn‚Äôt competing in a field getting flooded with services: Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Paramount, Apple, I could go on, all about $20 per month each. I‚Äôm considering dropping it because it doesn‚Äôt measure up.",20,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T22:09:46Z,2022-04-19

The post bot updates the price and volume every five minutes. The bullet points for each update are either a red or green square emoji to indicate the candle for that period. Well, I don't remember seeing white square emojis before and there were several in a row today. 

Does anyone know what this means, or if it could be significant? The periods have volume but no price change. I understand white candle = no price change, but can anyone look at other factors and see why the price went completely sideways for 20 minutes?

There was also lots of buzz about the price ""glitching"" and showing as $109 momentarily and then correcting back to the ""real"" price. Soon maybe there's something weird there too.

Will post this that I've written so far, and then edit in another second , with the link to the daily German market thread below.

EDIT : https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u6xzr1/diamantenh√§nde_german_market_is_open/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

There's the German market thread for today.

There are 7 white (no price change) bullets out of 26 total points. $144.85 is flat with no change for twenty whole minutes? 

Volume during these periods is 2500 to 3500. While low and high volumes for the day are 816 and 4755 respectively. So it's not as if they have low volume causing lack of price change. The price is changing even at 816 volume.",14,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T08:05:32Z,2022-04-19

A market where the average American can invest in the companies they like and reap the benefits of long-term hodling and reinvesting both in itself, the employees, and the investors?

Is it too much to ask that the average person could just buy a handful of shares and not have to worry about those shares being used against them to ruin their investment and kill off good American companies?

This group has exposed more fraudulent behavior within the stock market than anyone would have believed a couple years ago. I'm here for the loot box, but I'm also here to expose the criminals running the game and getting away with financial terrorism.

4929,gme,Superstonk,POST,I left my job in September because of my conviction of gme.,"The real reason? I spent 8 years of my life dealing with customers and my boss, in a restaurant. I love my boss, he‚Äôs a mentor of mine, but he runs a tight ship and the stress of striving for greatness each and every shift for 8 years starts to drain you. There were more good times than bad times, but the bad times were bad. I learned a lot and was ready to move on in my life, I‚Äôm an actor and I‚Äôve always dreamt of pursuing my passion full time ‚Äî something that can be or seem unattainable without steady income, especially in NYC. So many times I was ready to take the leap of faith and leave my job, but could never muster the courage to do it when I thought about it logically. It just didn‚Äôt make sense. 

GME has given me faith. I am and have been utterly convinced since February last year that moass is inevitable. I‚Äôm not and wasn‚Äôt banking on it happening anytime soon ( *it‚Äôs tomorrow* ) before I left, but the pure conviction it gave me, actually allowed me to muster the courage to leap. It opened up a door I‚Äôve been waiting years to open. 

I don‚Äôt live off my gme. Haven‚Äôt sold a single stock and haven‚Äôt needed too. I‚Äôve picked up some random jobs here and there and found money where I wasn‚Äôt able to see it before. I also saved up a bit before I left and made some decent cry-pto trades along the way. 

I‚Äôm getting married in August, I‚Äôve been immersed in acting and film work like never before, I‚Äôm producing a film with a public fundraiser, and I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve been in a very long time. I‚Äôd like to sincerely thank people of this community who are outspoken and take the countless hours to write up DD on our favorite stock. When I got into gme I was shitting my pants, but reading and staying up all night devouring all the DD I could really solidified my conviction for this. Thank you. You know who you are. You‚Äôve played a part in my life, as I‚Äôm sure you have others as well. You‚Äôve changed my life for the better. Seriously. 

That‚Äôs it really, I just wanted to post this because I have nothing of note to contribute other than buy, hodl, drs. I have my story, I have my conviction. I tell as many people as I can about gme and do my best to relay what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôve gotten alot of people on this train. 

 Best of luck to you all in your lives, although you won‚Äôt need it where you‚Äôre going üöÄüåï. Enjoy it, you only have 1. Proud to be an ape.

I was a Senior IT Consultant and was with my previous company for six years... during half my tenor my company was acquired by a multi-conglomerate firm. Pretty much the usual story: a big company comes in, changes the culture and policies, and people leave. My immediate coworkers were great... my boss not so much. But, overall just *coasting* until MOASS kicked off. 

However, my last straw was my company's extremely pathetic attempt of giving me a pay raise. My next raise was set to be only *.5%*... this was after not receiving a raise the last two years. Our company was profitable between 2020-2021 :)

I made a calculated risk, abruptly quit my job in December of 2021, and have not looked back since! Been incredibly stressed-free and digging into my hobbies without the worry of time or schedule.

4941,gme,Superstonk,POST,Why Elon Musk Will Never Buy GME,"##TLDR

Over the past few days I‚Äôve seen a recommended [tweet](https://twitter.com/kyl0z3n/status/1514730018894712839) or [two](https://twitter.com/benjamino69420/status/1514782903770632201) encouraging Elon Musk to buy shares of $GME with the hope, seemingly, that doing so would be a MOASS catalyst.  While some might chalk this up to nothing more than a side-effect of recent Twitter theatrics, I think there are some less-obvious reasons ‚Äî unrelated to being a [bullied billionaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u4jwqy/are_billionaires_or_wealthy_public_figures_being/) ‚Äî that explain why **Elon Musk will never go full Ape and buy $GME**.  What seems more likely to me is that many of these billionaires *always have been* the public face of the behind-the-scenes bullies working against the interests of Retail Investors. 

##Background

My last due diligence [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s649s0/penultimate_peril_ark_invest_and_the_mechanics_of) from 3 months ago concluded with one key point ‚Äî Credit Suisse and Nomura had Archegos exposure that I believed would expire sometime between late January and mid February 2022, resulting in forced institutional buying.

While this anticipation turned out to be a few weeks premature, there now seems to be a logical explanation as to why:

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶an injunction that prevents Archegos‚Äôs creditors from forcing it into bankruptcy to try to collect what they are owed expires at the end of March.‚Äù - [Financial Times - March 1st, 2021](https://www.ft.com/content/96d549b5-31c0-4d24-9a57-dc58a203ec8e)

This was the first post I‚Äôm aware of that mentioned any kind of injunction and I suspect it‚Äôs what was used as justification by institutions (e.g. the so-called *[Plunge Protection Team](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp)*) while selling billions of dollars worth of puts on 01/24/22 to pacify volatility when the $VIX eclipsed it‚Äôs 2021 high.

The expiration of the Archegos injunction was not the only interesting thing that happened towards the end of March. On 03/31/22:
1. $GME gapped up from it‚Äôs close of $166.58 to $188.90 during after hours trading
2. Citadel [redeemed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/citadel-to-further-reduce-2-billion-melvin-capital-investment) another $500mil of their 2021 Melvin Capital investment
3. u/Superstonk moderators posted [this](https://discord.com/channels/841716774554042439/914589091327246366/959224401776234556) message in the subreddit‚Äôs awesome Discord chat basically congratulating the community on being right!

While I believe Retail Investors successfully anticipating a major market event over the past year is an extraordinary achievement, I‚Äôm not sure all Institutional Investors feel the same way and I think the reason why has to do with one primary thing ‚Äî ***leverage***.

##Hypothesis

> ‚ÄúIf any one of the companies in the LCDX basket succeeded then whomever was being propped up by leverage from concentrated shorts would be negatively impacted (e.g. Ark Invest‚Äôs portfolio).‚Äù - [Me, 3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s649s0/penultimate_peril_ark_invest_and_the_mechanics_of)

This is the simplest TLDR explanation for why I believe:
1. Firms like Ark Invest, Tiger Global, and Melvin Capital are down 30-50%+ YoY
2. $FB experienced the largest one-day value drop in stock market history during February 2022
3. $SHOP, $Z, $DOCU, $TWTR, $NFLX and many others are all down +50% from their all-time highs realized during 2021 
4. Countless executives have either [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/jack-dorsey-twitter.html) from leadership positions, [joined boards](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/shopify-ceo-joins-coinbase-board-of-directors/) of companies with overlapping investors, or [divorced](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html) their significant others

It‚Äôs the leverage gained through a securitization scheme dependent upon alleged [insurance fraud](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/tokio-marine-accuses-greensill-of-fraud-in-tense-legal-battle-401516.aspx), quarterbacked by Credit Suisse in conjunction with Archegos and Greensill Capital groups, that ties them all together. 

While culpability obviously varies across involved parties, what‚Äôs now clear is that some behaved in a particularly heinous manner.  Take Ark Invest and their unironically titled report from 2020 titled the ‚Äú*[Bad Ideas Report](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ArkInvest_101420_Whitepaper_BadIdeas2020.pdf)*,‚Äù for example.  The firm appears not only to have been advertising *against* the very industries it was extracting leverage *from*, but also to have been making investments *in* companies that would benefit by the failure *of* those they were advertising *against* ‚Äî all with the support of silent whales like Archegos [pumping](https://www.wsj.com/articles/executives-wonder-if-their-stock-selloffs-were-linked-to-archegos-11618997403) their preferred companies along the way.

Elon Musk and $TSLA were obvious beneficiaries of this scheme and now appear to be frantically attempting to regain their edge after 10 years of uncompetitive and inorganic price discovery.  Musk‚Äôs latest gimmick seems to involve his best emulation of Ryan Cohen, treating the ‚ÄúBig Tech‚Äù companies as his own poisoned LCDX basket prime for a turnaround and blaming board members for their inaction, despite having personally benefited from the same toxic investment environment that lulled those very boards into complacency.

Which is why when Apollo Global Management [announced](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-global-considers-participating-in-bid-for-twitter-11650313013) their interest in Twitter alongside Elon Musk earlier this evening, I was immediately reminded of his [friend](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-ready-to-step-in-for-lloyd-blankfein-1443657981) and former Goldman Sachs‚Äô President Gary Cohn whose SPAC CohnRobbins is now taking Apollo-owned Czech lottery operator Allwyn Entertainment [public](https://www.ft.com/content/37a48ffb-59b4-446f-98f5-723f6864ddd6).  What‚Äôs interesting about CohnRobbins is that their CCO Robert Rasamny became the Melvin Capital CCO during December 2020, which I have previously [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/r9g1q9/the_melvin_capital_misdirection_part_two_the/) was in relation to a *[private credit repayment](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/easy-exit-spacs-spell-quick-repayments-for-private-credit-63130191)* scheme in anticipation of Greensill‚Äôs loans losing syndication through Tokio Marine.  Rasamny has since been removed from the CohnRobbins‚Äô website since the original connection was made several months ago.

This trail of breadcrumbs between Elon Musk, Gary Cohn, and Melvin Capital are major reasons why I believe this (since deleted) [tweet](https://imgur.com/gallery/wNIkt9c) by Elon Musk on Christmas Day 2020 is a major clue for those interested in the question of how and why the buy button was disabled in January 2021.  For those of you who don‚Äôt click on the link - it‚Äôs an image of shorts with the word ‚Äús3xy‚Äù on one cheek and the picture of a dog on the other ‚Äî which I believe was a signal to short sellers to load up on a certain altcoin in anticipation of the pre-ordained disabling of broker buy buttons after Elon‚Äôs ‚ÄúGameStonk‚Äù tweet.  

I‚Äôve long wondered if Musk knew short sellers needed a new way to collateralize their positions with the collapse of Greensill and found a way to do so through Robinhood, a company that: 
1. Was increasingly involved in the OTC markets throughout 2021
2. Has been heavily invested in by Ark Invest and
3. Is rumored to be a certain altcoin [whale](https://www.benzinga.com/content/24287928). 

So it felt all too coincidental when Robinhood was among several entities to [liquidate](https://www.benzinga.com/content/26311062) altcoin holdings on March 26th, 2022 (just a few days ahead of Archegos‚Äô injunction expiration).

Seems like Elon Musk was complicit in taking money from less-savvy Retail Investors unaware their capital would eventually be used to potentially pay off debts associated with soured short sales. 

##Conclusion
These are the reasons why I believe Musk is not your friend in the way he‚Äôd like you to think.  He is no Ape, and I do not expect him to ever be a $GME whale unless it was part of a PR stunt.  I have serious concerns related to Musk and Apollo‚Äôs interest in Twitter, and suspect that neither are  fans of Ryan Cohen‚Äôs growing influence on the platform.

If you‚Äôre now wondering, ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt $TSLA targeted by short sellers just like $GME?‚Äù  You‚Äôre right, they were ‚Äî and that‚Äôs something to be excited about because its one of the reasons why I think $GME will just keep squeezing.  

Elon‚Äôs scheming and $GME‚Äôs short interest doubling over the past few months are, to me, incredibly bullish indicators and obvious signals that shorts have not yet closed.

Tonight's tweet had me thinking that some of the newer apes may not have seen this meme series. Some of it will feel dated since most of the scenes were made last summer. Sit back and enjoy the meme movie. More scenes will drop at a later date.

5007,gme,Superstonk,POST,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers (Funds 4 - 7 Added) - Why Are Funds Holding Shares of Exchanges? üï∏Ô∏è‚è∞‚òéÔ∏èüí•,"Reposting from this morning. Not really sure what was going on with the post, but here we go, again.

**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**Update to Original Post:**

* Added onto the TL;DR
* I've added onto and clarified AIG's 2008 securities lending losses within this post to include information that funds, and borrower loses could be substantial worse for GME securities lending counterparties, and
* included new funds

**If you've read the prior posts and are just here for the updated funds, please proceed to Example 4**. Otherwise, here you go.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks/prime brokers) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs (funds). The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read as it shows the interconnectedness of the entities involved and how everyone, from the short seller all the way back to the shareholders of the funds loaning the GME shares are exposed to potentially catastrophic losses during MOASS, which is why I believe my shares are safest at Computershare.

Background Information

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

There are **two main types of securities lending risks**.

**The first risk** type is what AIG experienced as the collateral they received from the lent securities was reinvested in illiquid high-risk assets, including assets backed by subprime residential mortgage loans which lost value during the sell-offs.

In 2014, current SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce had the following to say; *Through the securities lending program, AIG and its life insurance subsidiaries had massive exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities. At the height of the 2008 crisis, the program experienced a run, and AIG could not meet the massive repayment demands.* ***The losses in the securities lending program were severe enough to imperil a number of AIG‚Äôs regulated life insurance subsidiaries. Before the bailout, AIG itself may have been insolvent.*** [\[Source\]](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/financial-markets/securities-lending-and-untold-story-collapse-aig)

In order to close a securities lending transaction, the fund needs to return the collateral to the borrower when the borrower returns the share, which would mean the fund would need to close some of its positions unless it has the collateral already set aside, which it most likely does not because **everybody wants more money**. Since AIG reinvested the collateral they received in dog shit wrapped cat shit, the collateral had lost a lot of value and wasn't worth as much when they needed to cash out.

If you want to get really technical on 2008 securities lending issues, check out [Securities Lending & Why Wall Street Sold 2.5T Treasury IOU's Last October](http://www.24hgold.com/english/news-gold-silver-securities-lending-and-why-wall-street-sold-2-5-trillion-treasury-ious-last-october.aspx?contributor=Eric+de+Carbonnel&article=2507793268G10020&redirect=False)

**The second risk** **type** ***relates to a worst-case scenario*** *-- when a borrower, such as a hedge fund or investment bank, collapses and is unable or unwilling to return assets to the fund. Let's use Fannie Mae (2008) bonds as an example. A fund accepts Fannie Mae bonds as collateral, and while holding that paper, its value decreases. The agreement calls for these securities to be marked to market daily, with any decrease in value covered by the borrower. However, if the borrower fails to increase the amount of the collateral, and does not return the borrowed securities when they are due, the fund now has collateral worth less than the value of the securities lent out, and it experiences a loss in its net asset value.* [\[Thanks Motley Fool\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/10/16/the-risky-business-of-securities-lending.aspx)

Thinking of that AIG example, funds are currently lending GME shares to brokers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold...

During MOASS, the [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar but worse exposure to securities lending risks then the brokers who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The brokers currently borrowing and lending GME have a similar but worse [exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) than what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic for AIG and its counterparties... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds loaning the shares are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** **loaning the GME shares** (ex. BofA owns 11.6M shares worth $3.3B, of IJH) So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds loaning the shares.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares of the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds hold shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the NPORT [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tpm5si/nport_gme_deep_dive_so_much_gme_lending_total/) I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

* **138** of **213** funds were loaning GME shares
* **70** funds lent out more than **90% of their GME shares**
* An estimated **5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan** (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending),
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) on the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund...
* A lot of funds loaning the GME shares are managed by the same list of entities who are borrowing shares from the funds

I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks later in this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ‚âà 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this **fund's borrowers:**

[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/5vydi3gnidu81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8c816d285b57ea55a8efc58b95549e4cf161a26)

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out to hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is a **shareholder** of this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/h7nbskgvidu81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5d6b67e1d432298b44585a2f55b4feaa75fd9c)

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***borrower/lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

# But Wait... There's MOAR!

The fund has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the **fund's holdings:**

[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/cpw1348cjdu81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec07f47a8ac272f8cda4695a12057910eb434da)

 

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

# The Counterparty Risk

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However,* ***in*** ***recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.‚Äôs have become commonplace***\*. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.\*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can‚Äôt,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

Do you see the vastness of risks involved in the short selling process, especially if most of that short selling is naked short positions AND other hidden means?

Decentralized tokenized exchanges could potentially benefit from the fallout illegal naked short selling will cause the world's financial system ü§î

When short sellers are liquidated during MOASS, funds, fund shareholders, and fund borrowers are exposed to huge securities lending counterparty risks. The above information shows a small glimpse of the GME securities lending taking place and the potential exposures for everyone involved.

Again, these statistics do not include any information on rehypothecated shares, any other avenues of securities lending, or any form of short interest. This is merely the estimated number of shares on loan by some funds.

Every quarter of 2021, the NSCC has had this (or similar verbiage) to say regarding the Clearing Funds backtesting, *the largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a concentrated security* ***exhibiting idiosyncratic risk*** AND they didn't have enough cash on hand to cover the potential default of their largest member 5 times in 2021. This had never happened before. [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance)

*What's an exit strategy?*

**You want to get even wilder?** Go look at the main holdings and shareholders of **AGG, IGSB, & NEAR** to find out that **these entities are indirectly holding their own and each other's debt through ETFs.**

**Note 3:** If everything is starting to look like a web, maybe there is a hub? I feel it important to point out that A LOT of entities listed as borrowers or shareholders of the funds above, are also listed on the **W\^E\^F PARTNERS** [**PAGE**](https://www.weforum.org/partners#D) **including** [**BCG**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1512103363311243269?cxt=HHwWisC4nev_iPwpAAAA) **& the DTCC** along with a lot of other familiar faces, including [Ken Griffin](https://thefundchicago.org/who-we-are/board/kenneth-griffin/). Maybe there is a connection, maybe it is complete coincidence. When coincidences pile up though, it's worth looking into them.

**Note 4:** I am not a financial advisor and none of this information is financial advice. I am simply providing information that is publicly available.

Either no one believes us, or we are totally overblowing things without a full understanding of all the market mechanics, or institutions are ignorant, dumb, and willfully ignoring things. I mean, why would a non-Citadel insider (from the ape conversation again) care to protect Citadel and say ‚Äúwe are aware of it‚Äù. It‚Äôs not like they care about Citadel at all. So they have no reason to not believe us other than they think we are wrong or are going to lose or are scared to speak the truth. Are we really the only ones signaling the alarm?

You may look at it and think you own the share, then you uncover the first layer and notice there is another ""owner"" inside, uncover the second layer and notice there's yet another ""owner"" of that same share, and so on and so forth. **SO MANY LAYERS, SO MANY ALLEGED OWNERS BUT ONLY ONE SHARE.**

Turns out, you don't really own that share my friend.

**The only way to remove all the layers and be the true owner of your share is by Directly Registrering that share to your name.**

EDIT: OP, you can add this to your post if you wanted to. It took me too long to post it on your repost this time.",3,u6sdsn,2022-04-19T08:49:08Z,2022-04-19

My smoothness limits my capacity, but I‚Äôve seen people saying they will HODL part of their shares forever for many reasons. One of the most compelling is the fact that this is a good company and they want to demonstrate continued support. I agree with them.

That being said, however, come MOASS and, if projections are right, prices soar to the $1M+, wouldn‚Äôt it be a better approach to close the entire position along multiple exit points (I suppose the MOASS as an event may span through several weeks) and then, armed with a significant wallet, re-buy a large position after the price settles down in its rightful place (probably along the $10-30k range per share)?

There must be some flaw in my reasoning, but I‚Äôd really like to know the benefits of HODLING indefinitely compared to the smooth-brain strategy I just outlined.

I have an exit strategy but I would never assume to think my strategy is the best or that other people should follow it. For the record my strategy includes holding a big portion for a long time, and not getting out at the top (that would be purely luck).

As to buying back in‚Ä¶. How?  Many of us are never selling a decent portion of our shares. Any drop in price that is significant will be met with buy offers. So we will be bidding against the DTCC for shares that still aren‚Äôt sold. 2 buy for 1 sell means price stays high 

If you‚Äôre serious and not shilling consider the following strategy. 

Sell 1 if needed for runway money. This keeps you going for months. Maybe years. Pays off your debt. 

Sell 2nd for retirement money. Not Lamborghini retirement. Quiet nice retirement 

Any sales after are gravy. Maybe a nicer house. Car. Etc. 

At some point if you sell 1 at a time and slow enough you‚Äôll have tons of money. Most of your shares left and frankly get bored of selling. 

Sorry. But your idea of cashing out all your shares at a certain price is the absolute worst idea.

5173,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What are the reasons people should keep any of their GME during MOASS?,"This is a very valid thought process, and isn't shilly at all in my opinion.  The idea as another commenter mentioned is to make sure X and XX holders are able to get theirs before allowing SHF to fully cover.

The thing to remember is not selling on the way up, but on the way down.  Everyone is different and in a different situation in life, so if some people want to watch the price go from $2,214,045 back down to $7,034 and just ""HODL"" to prove a point, that's great for them.  I personally would like to retire from my shitty job, and selling at $7k per share won't let me do that, so you'll see me selling on the way back down at a 7-digit number so I can experience that generational, life changing, world helping wealth so many have been talking about.  Call me paperhands if you want lol, but I'm not going to watch millions turn into a couple hundred thousand and then be like ""DIAMOND HANDS!"" and feel good about it...

At the end of the day, everyone will play it differently.  You'll have people saying ""don't sell on the way up"" but then can't help themselves.  You'll have some people selling off 1 share at a time.  You'll have some people offloading XX shares at a certain price point.  You'll have some people with 1-2 shares that are holding like true diamond hands past 6-figures...you need to figure out what is best for you, ahead of time, and then stick to it.  The numbers are going to get ridiculous, and calculator will become your new most addicting video game ever...keep the calculator away and stick to your original plan, and then you can stay zen throughout the process.

5186,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What are the reasons people should keep any of their GME during MOASS?,"I have not read the infinity pool DD, but I do ascribe to that concept.  The main DD discusses counterfeit shares that are indistinguishable from real shares.   When the DRS effort completes and we inevitably (tomorrow or 3 years from now) lock the float (maybe after some whale comes in and drives a final deathblow with a large DRS), that will confirm the bulk of ""stock"" held in Fidelity, TDA, etc are not real shares.

I believe at that point there will be no ""fiscally responsible"" choice for institutions to honor those IOUs and I believe all positions will be closed at cost basis or maybe at a 20% premium.  I'm not sure how this scenario effects the overall share price in the short term.  I've tried to understand the Barclay's VXX debacle and I believe that is how that situation is being approached, but boy do I have a hard time understanding it.   

Sure, this will be devastating for those not DRS'd, but I also believe that will force shorts to close ONLY through DRS share purchases, as brokers will no longer be able to sell the proven counterfeit shares.   If they truly are 200% or more short, then I don't see how it is possible for them to close.  As they buy 1 DRS share, they now own that share and can no longer buy it.  We could all paperhand, and they would still own only 75 million-ish shares, needing to close 125 million+ still.  

In reality though, many apes and insiders will not sell their DRS'd shares, making it impossible for SHF's to buy more than say 45-50 million.  

I don't see a way out.  Maybe through a presidential executive order or act of congress, but even then, it would have to be a negotiated deal with the board (of our NYSE listed company that can't be just forcibly bankrupted by the federal government out of convenience...we think), who has our backs.   

If enough paperhand, will SHF then have a controlling stake in the company, which they then force into insovlency or negotiate a bad deal?   No idea how that one plays out, but my guess is there would be a poison pill before that scenario came to pass.  

I'm very smooth and know little about the market, so all of this is my own rumination of the proverbial question, ""how does this all end?""   I just can't figure out how it ends and I'm excited we seem to be closer.  

Anyway, I have a lot of shares in IRAs that I can't DRS and I can't afford the tax it.   We'll see what happens to those, but I feel that if Fidelity does hose us on those, my DRS'd shares will be invaluable at that point and that helps me sleep quite soundly at night.",3,u6oh9e,2022-04-18T23:07:44Z,2022-04-18

**********

people have @#$@#$ lost their mind if they think GME post MOASS long term prices are going to come anywhere close to MOASS prices

MOASS prices -> Millions a share (best case estimate)

post MOASS long term price of GME -> in thousands of dollars a share (best case scenario)

So, what you have written i.e. sell when price is in millions during MOASS

buy back in thousands after MOASS

is the BEST strategy and is indisputable. You can argue at what point during MOASS to sell. However, there is no logical argument to not sell during MOASS or right at end of MOASS

Long term GME might be just in $1,000 to $3,000 a share range

So selling during MOASS is best strategy

****************

also GME rightful place is NOT $10,000 to $30,000 range

Even if they get marketplace right, the stock price is going to spend many years in $500 to $3,000 range before it eventually goes higher

so you are going to be able to buy in after MOASS at $500 to $3,000 range, for sure",-3,u6oh9e,2022-04-18T21:56:00Z,2022-04-18

5204,gme,Superstonk,POST,"Debunking ""Something pretty important from GME‚Äôs 10-K that I haven‚Äôt seen discussed here at all""","In his post u/catsinbranches (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u62um8/something_pretty_important_from_gmes_10k_that_i/) makes a few assertions which seem to be incorrect or at least a reach.

#1

If you look at the cover page of GME's 10-K you will see the following info.

>The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. (For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)

Using this info, you can infer a Jan 2022 float of 12,000/161.12 or 74.5M shares.

This is in contrast to the analyst-reported float of 65.2M for July 31, 2021.

The difference is a remarkable 9.3M shares.

OP asserts that this difference is GME somehow showing us a more realistic short-interest number. (Which is weird because he carefully explains how short shares are not reported well and their rights are not responsibility of the company.)

However, this difference is remarkable not for it's size but rather for the fact that Ryan Cohen Enterprises, LLC, being neither a director nor officer of GME, held 9.0M shares at the time. (Read the above again after ""for the purposes of this calculation...."")

This resolves almost the entire difference and the remainder is immaterial.

#2

You will notice OP uses the July 21, 2021 float number. This is to match the stock price date. However, the stock price date is used as the year's midpoint. The shares may be as of the end of the period (Jan 29, 2022) or a weighted average. Not sure. Any apes know for certain?

Without citing the Jan 29, 2022 float we have no idea what the actual difference is.

#3

But to dig into the difference further, it is important to note the the numbers on the cover page of the 10-K include unvested shares, while the numbers on the financial statements themselves do not.

from the 10-K

> Shares of restricted stock ... are included in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding disclosed on the cover page.... In accordance with accounting guidance, the financial statement presentation excludes unvested shares of restricted Class A Common Stock.

So the analysts may have also removed the 1.3M unvested shares as of Jan 29, 2022 in addition to RC Entprises 9.0M. This would need the Jan 29, 2022 float to figure this out.

#4

Working from 3 above, we will see a problem with the analysis OP did for several other companies. He is showing a systematic difference between shares on cover pages and reported float. Well yeah, cover pages probably all include unvested shares.

Or maybe some other subtle change in calculation. *The entire point of the cover page calc is to show the biggest possible value for the company.*

#5

OP makes the additional claim that the data feeds are suspect because of an **unexplained** 5M share increase in the float between ""July 20 2021 and August 16 2021"". From GME's own financial statements we can see that shares issued and outstanding are

    69.3M on May 1, 2021 and
    75.9M on July 31, 2021

So if the data feed is using the *latest official numbers* then there will be a 6.6M share increase between those dates. If the analyst data includes vested shares, the increase is from 71.9M to 76.5M...or 4.6M shares.",148,u6ll9t,2022-04-18T19:41:09Z,2022-04-18

Community loyalty and involvement is one of GME‚Äôs greatest strengths but they‚Äôre spinning it to the masses as a weakness.,"It‚Äôs more media FUD in the vein of ‚Äòappear strong when you‚Äôre weak, weak when you‚Äôre strong‚Äô. Except in this case they‚Äôre trying to make outsiders perceive one of GME‚Äôs greatest strengths as a weakness.

How on earth could it be a bad thing to have a huge dedicated core group of investors who will never stop buying shares, never stop buying products from the company, and never stop supporting that company in various other ways like diamond handing shares, positive word of mouth, aligning with Cohen‚Äôs vision in voting initiatives, generating ideas for avenues of growth, and so much more.

Grassroots, word of mouth advertising is the gold standard. Every company hopes they can take their brand to a place where their loyal customers do the advertising for them. Not only is it free, it‚Äôs also more powerful. Any good advertiser will tell you that when people hear about a product or service from friends or family members it‚Äôs worth a lot more than hearing about it from traditional advertising sources.

One of the big reasons GME is becoming a powerhouse is because of us, the shareholders. We‚Äôre holding it down and giving management the time and space to enact the turnaround.

Any publicly traded company in the world would be over the moon at having the investor base GME has. The shills say we have a short attention span and will lose interest. Well, most of us have been in this play for over 16 months and are more passionate about GME now than we were when we began.

When doing fundamental analysis on GME it would be idiotic to keep the loyal, diamond handed, ever growing investor base out of the equation. 

Not only are the shills discounting it, they actually have the balls to spin it as a knock against GameStop. ü§£",1127,u6kaj9,2022-04-18T18:43:49Z,2022-04-18

Your customers are the ones making you the money. 

One reason this system is so fucked is because big companies have forgotten that. They only care about getting theirs, and they don't care if it comes from customers or investors. Actually, they probably prefer investor funding because they get paid without having to actually deliver on their promises. Execs walk away with a nice salary while the company goes mismanaged.

GME is doing it right. Their board members get a (comparably) small salary, but are primarily compensated through their stock. Security to live comfortably, so they can make educated risks in the company and grow their wealth that way. And, with so many customers direct registering, and LITERALLY TELLING THEM EXACTLY HOW TO TAKE THEIR MONEY WITH SUGGESTIONS, GME is going to moonshot even without MOASS. 

There is a sickness on Wallstreet, where a few people think they get to decide everything for everyone. Sorry, that video game company doesn't get to exist anymore. We need their real estate cheap so we can charge unaffordable rent to copy-paste burger joints. No, I'm sorry Wallstreet fucks. You don't own this country. All you are are a bunch of greedy middlemen who don't actually provide anything. You only act as a broker, taking fees and stock, and making risky bets because you are addicted to your lifestyle. It's time for your kind to die out. It's time for a financial revolotion.

Power to the mutherfucking players. Individuals run this shit. We don't need you to tell us what is good and what is bad. We can just vote with our dollars. Sorry you disagree. Maybe make a competitor? Or is that too hard for you fat lazy wallstreet cucks?",1,u6kaj9,2022-04-19T04:38:34Z,2022-04-19

5386,gme,Superstonk,POST,Theory on why they keep shorting GME...,"So, imagine you are Ken Griffin or Steve Cohen, or any of the other big players that have overloaded their portfolios with naked shorts on GME.  They doubled down during the Sneeze, betting that retail investors would succumb to the time-tested psychological intimidation tactics employed by SHFs to make the little guys sell their positions.  When they realized that retail investors were holding strong because we are no longer ignorant of the scripted game, and are no longer intimidated by MSM analysts or financial ""journalists"" reporting negatively about the company, the hedgies were forced to reevaluate their approach.

SHFs know that there is zero chance of GameStop going bankrupt, now.  That reality occurred while SHFs extended their naked shorts positions into the stratosphere trying to shake loose retail investors.  Now, GameStop insiders have substantially added to their positions and GME is beginning to attract large, publicly known names into the long pool.  We are very close to MOASS and the game is about to be over.

Since the SHFs see where this is heading, haven't you wondered why they aren't jumping on the winning side of this trade?  I suspect it's because they have so many FTDs that going long would simply be used to clear shares they already owe.  The solution for them would be to unload their short positions onto some poor fool who is unaware of the shit storm brewing on the horizon.  

The only way they could do this is to convince some naive, albeit very rich, investors that GME has a bad future outlook and is surely going to fail (articles in Marketwatch, Motley Fool, Benzinga, etc. & CNBC interviews/Jim Cramer, etc.).  To support what a terrible company GameStop is, just look at how the price is plummeting.  This all seems like a perfect setup to convince other people that they will make tons of money by shorting GME.  How convenient that those new positions could relieve the SHFs of their one way ticket to the poor house.  

After that crap is unloaded on the same sort of rubes that invested (and lost) fortunes with Bernie Madoff, then SHFs could go long GME and capitalize on the inevitable MOASS.

I have absolutely no proof that any of this is happening.  I just don't find it unlikely.",62,u6ipfh,2022-04-18T17:35:39Z,2022-04-18

5441,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Trading just changed for GME - Im excited for this week but excited for this afternoon also... Just some observations...,"This was not shorting at all man. Look at the options chain. All the weekly options fro. Last week are gone and the majority of out the money prices that were hedged for disappeared. This allowed market makers to offload the hedged shares without risk. It's called delta hedging and right now there is no need for anything above $150 so we naturally fell back to the levels they need to hedge for, the 125-140 channel.

Unless there's some sort of large purchasing or announcement that bring in massive amounts of options buying above the 140 150 range we will see this drop the way that it did. 


TLDR - The price rose due to hedging and options chain because of fomo from RC buying and dividend announcement.  And with the fomo options from that expiring in last weeks monthly option chain, market makers can offload any unnecessary shares.",103,u6htr4,2022-04-18T17:40:23Z,2022-04-18

5470,gme,Superstonk,POST,"Huh, ya don't say? A cellar stock returns GME on a ""Similar to"" list.","Was doing some data collection for a fun little project, came across this PUPS ticker with only one stock generated in the ""Similar to"" list. Clearly, this company is entirely unrelated to GME. Also worth noting that there is a ""People also watch"" list above this one and it didn't make it into the screen grab. So I don't think GME's appearance has anything to do with similar engagements or anything like that. Any theories? Would love a shill's opinion mostly, bring it.

5504,gme,Superstonk,POST,anyone look into OG meme NAKD 'reverse' split and how it may correlate to GME upcoming regular split?,"Haven't seen anyone mention or look into this yet so thought I would bring it up as it may now be relevant with GME's upcoming stock split dividend.


Another stock that was in the short basket was naked brand NAKD, now under ticker CENN as of Jan 13,2022. I watch all the OG meme basket stocks just for fun. What's interesting with naked brand in particular is that they underwent a 'reverse' split on Dec 22,2021. This was a 15:1 reverse split. Please note that this is a 'REVERSE' split, this is the opposite of a stock split and the opposite of what GME will be doing. In a reverse split you had 15 shares now you only have 1.


Take a look at the chart.  Price absolutely plummets after the REVERSE split. $6.25 to $2.00 in a month. Please note again this was the opposite type of split GME is doing.


Why I'm interested in this is that it may help show that a 'REVERSE' split is very damaging in a heavily shorted basket stock. If we correlate the opposite, then a regular stock split in a heavily shorted basket stock should be very beneficial.


TLDR; NAKD gives us a good example of how a 'REVERSE' split with a meme basket stock plays out. NAKD got destroyed after the 'REVERSE' split. GME is doing the opposite and giving a regular split in the form of a share dividend so should see some big gains after the split if they correlate to each other.",8,u6euqd,2022-04-18T14:46:16Z,2022-04-18

5587,gme,Superstonk,POST,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers (Funds 4 - 7 Added) - Why Are Funds Holding Shares of Exchanges? üï∏Ô∏è‚è∞‚òéÔ∏èüí•,"**EDIT:** I'm not sure what's going on but I'm not going to delete the post. A lot of people can't see any of the content, some people can't see any of the pictures, and two or three people told me they can see the entire post. I will repost this later tonight and see if we have better luck.

**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**Update to Original Post:**

* Added onto the TL;DR
* I've added onto and clarified AIG's 2008 securities lending losses within this post to include information that funds, and borrower loses could be substantial worse for GME securities lending counterparties, and
* included new funds

**If you've read the prior posts and are just here for the updated funds, please proceed to Ralph Wiggum**. Otherwise, here you go.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks/prime brokers) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs (funds). The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read as it shows the interconnectedness of the entities involved and how everyone, from the short seller all the way back to the shareholders of the funds loaning the GME shares are exposed to potentially catastrophic losses during MOASS, which is why I believe my shares are safest at Computershare.

# Background Information

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

There are **two main types of securities lending risks**.

**The first risk** type is what AIG experienced as the collateral they received from the lent securities was reinvested in illiquid high-risk assets, including assets backed by subprime residential mortgage loans which lost value during the sell-offs.

In 2014, current SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce had the following to say; *Through the securities lending program, AIG and its life insurance subsidiaries had massive exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities. At the height of the 2008 crisis, the program experienced a run, and AIG could not meet the massive repayment demands.* ***The losses in the securities lending program were severe enough to imperil a number of AIG‚Äôs regulated life insurance subsidiaries. Before the bailout, AIG itself may have been insolvent.*** [\[Source\]](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/financial-markets/securities-lending-and-untold-story-collapse-aig)

In order to close a securities lending transaction, the fund needs to return the collateral to the borrower when the borrower returns the share, which would mean the fund would need to close some of its positions unless it has the collateral already set aside, which it most likely does not because **everybody wants more money**. Since AIG reinvested the collateral they received in dog shit wrapped cat shit, the collateral had lost a lot of value and wasn't worth as much when they needed to cash out.

If you want to get really technical on 2008 securities lending issues, check out [Securities Lending & Why Wall Street Sold 2.5T Treasury IOU's Last October](http://www.24hgold.com/english/news-gold-silver-securities-lending-and-why-wall-street-sold-2-5-trillion-treasury-ious-last-october.aspx?contributor=Eric+de+Carbonnel&article=2507793268G10020&redirect=False)

**The second risk** **type** ***relates to a worst-case scenario*** *-- when a borrower, such as a hedge fund or investment bank, collapses and is unable or unwilling to return assets to the fund. Let's use Fannie Mae (2008) bonds as an example. A fund accepts Fannie Mae bonds as collateral, and while holding that paper, its value decreases. The agreement calls for these securities to be marked to market daily, with any decrease in value covered by the borrower. However, if the borrower fails to increase the amount of the collateral, and does not return the borrowed securities when they are due, the fund now has collateral worth less than the value of the securities lent out, and it experiences a loss in its net asset value.* [\[Thanks Motley Fool\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/10/16/the-risky-business-of-securities-lending.aspx)

Thinking of that AIG example, funds are currently lending GME shares to brokers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold...

During MOASS, the [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar but worse exposure to securities lending risks then the brokers who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The brokers currently borrowing and lending GME have a similar but worse [exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) than what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic for AIG and its counterparties... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds loaning the shares are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** **loaning the GME shares** (ex. BofA owns 11.6M shares worth $3.3B, of IJH) So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds loaning the shares.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

&#x200B;

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares of the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds hold shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the NPORT [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tpm5si/nport_gme_deep_dive_so_much_gme_lending_total/) I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

&#x200B;

* **138** of **213** funds were loaning GME shares
* **70** funds lent out more than **90% of their GME shares**
* An estimated **5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan** (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending),
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) on      the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund...
* A lot of funds loaning the GME shares are managed by the same list of entities who are borrowing shares from the funds

I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks later in this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ‚âà 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:

*Processing img wtyi16w43et81...*

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out to hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

*Processing img 1a2zzo083et81...*

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***borrower/lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

# But Wait... There's MOAR!

The fund has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:

*Processing img lkwunc4e3et81...*

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

# The Counterparty Risk

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However,* ***in*** ***recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.‚Äôs have become commonplace***\*. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.\*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can‚Äôt,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

Do you see the vastness of risks involved in the short selling process, especially if most of that short selling is naked short positions AND other hidden means?

Decentralized tokenized exchanges could potentially benefit from the fallout illegal naked short selling will cause the world's financial system ü§î

# fin

When short sellers are liquidated during MOASS, funds, fund shareholders, and fund borrowers are exposed to huge securities lending counterparty risks. The above information shows a small glimpse of the GME securities lending taking place and the potential exposures for everyone involved.

Again, these statistics do not include any information on rehypothecated shares, any other avenues of securities lending, or any form of short interest. This is merely the estimated number of shares on loan by some funds.

Every quarter of 2021, the NSCC has had this (or similar verbiage) to say regarding the Clearing Funds backtesting, *the largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a concentrated security* ***exhibiting idiosyncratic risk*** AND they didn't have enough cash on hand to cover the potential default of their largest member 5 times in 2021. This had never happened before. [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance)

*What's an exit strategy?*

**You want to get even wilder?** Go look at the main holdings and shareholders of **AGG, IGSB, & NEAR** to find out that **these entities are indirectly holding in their own and each other's debt through ETFs.**

**Note 3:** If everything is starting to look like a web, maybe there is a hub? I feel it important to point out that A LOT of entities listed as borrowers or shareholders of the funds above, are also listed on the **W\^E\^F PARTNERS** [**PAGE**](https://www.weforum.org/partners#D) **including** [**BCG**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1512103363311243269?cxt=HHwWisC4nev_iPwpAAAA) **& the DTCC** along with a lot of other familiar faces, including [Ken Griffin](https://thefundchicago.org/who-we-are/board/kenneth-griffin/). Maybe there is a connection, maybe it is complete coincidence. When coincidences pile up though, it's worth looking into them.

**Note 4:** I am not a financial advisor and none of this information is financial advice. I am simply providing information that is publicly available.

> PricewaterhouseCoopers, Lehman's bankruptcy administrator in the U.K., where its European prime brokerage was based, doesn't know how much money is at stake. [PwC said last month it's trying to recoup about $8 billion in cash that Lehman's parent company allegedly withdrew from its European unit before the collapse. It will take weeks, if not longer, to sort out the mess, according to PwC.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/lehman-hedge-fund-clients-left-cold-as-assets-frozen/articleshow/3551534.cms)

> Oak Group used Lehman's unit in London because it allowed the fund to borrow more than US prime brokers, James said. Operating under different regulatory requirements, European prime brokers have been more generous than their US counterparts, sometimes even within the same parent company, said Michael Romanek, principal at Rise Partners Ltd., which arranges financing for funds from London. ""A lot of US managers would rather deal with Europe than New York,"" said Romanek. ""Rarely do you see it go the other way."" James's account had pledged equity securities as collateral that Lehman then lent to other investors under a practice known as rehypothecation. It's the fate of that collateral that worries many Lehman hedge-fund clients.

>They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

The share you have at your broker is like a [matrioshka](https://c.tenor.com/jyB_HRqiiOMAAAAC/matryoshka-russian-doll.gif) (russian doll):

You may look at it and think you own the share, then you uncover the first layer and notice there is another ""owner"" inside, uncover the second layer and notice there's yet another ""owner"" of that same share, and so on and so forth. **SO MANY LAYERS, SO MANY ALLEGED OWNERS BUT ONLY ONE SHARE.**

Turns out, you don't really own that share my friend.

**The only way to remove all the layers and be the true owner of your share is by Directly Registrering that share to your name.**

Disclaimer: All data shown here is publicly available and can be downloaded and evaluated with the scripts I provide. Please read my previous posts for this. I do not claim the correctness of the data and the source code, everyone is invited to review, repeat and improve the analysis.

**GME is a highly volatile stock:**

As a measure of volatile, the one minute candles between 03/13/2022 and 04/13/2022 were evaluated. For this purpose, the standard deviation of the percentage change per minute was calculated and compared with all Russel 1000 tickers.

Std. of the percentual candle = standard deviation( (close - open)/open )

The following graph shows the results against the market cap.

**The volatility is driven by trading volume:**

The volatility can be driven by various factors, but if you take a look at the trading volume, it quickly becomes clear that it plays a decisive role.

As a measure of trading volume, the number of shares traded per minute is multiplied by the opening price and normalized to the market cap.

mean percentage volume dollar = mean( volume \* open ) / market cap

**Can retail generate this volume?**

**Short answer: No**

Long answer: Retail would have to keep selling each other shares to generate 0.42% of the market cap per minute. To generate such a high trading volume per minute you need both the financial resources and the infrastructure. Retail would quickly run out of money just because of the transaction fees and the spread, not to mention that trading algorithms with the necessary performance and infrastructure are needed.

In addition, retail is clearly a value investor at GME, which is clear from the published DRS figures, for example. In addition, the published data from fidelity show that retail buys both dip and rip. As the following graph illustrates. Data from the wayback archive was analyzed. Each point represents a saved status since 01.01.2021.

**Conclusion: MM, HF, Banks are driving the volume and thereby the volatility. They manipulate the price.**

**How is the price manipulated?**

It is not possible for Retail to provide direct evidence of manipulation as Retail does not have access to the necessary data. The process is not transparent. Therefore, retail has to rely on indirect indicators. An indirect indicator is the correlation between occurring gaps in one minute candles and the outstanding shares. The following graph illustrates this relationship for all Russel 1000 tickers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8u4gvqtg59u81.jpg?width=2098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1450c790675d3d102d0130c49708c75705b141e

The proportion of gaps in one minute candles is obviously much too small for the outstanding shares. Note the log scale. Here one can conclude that GME is traded as if it had approx. 10x outstanding shares. 

Put simply: If we did not know the outstanding shares and someone gave us this graph and the proportion of gaps for GME, where would we place GME?

**Challenge for Artificial Intelligence Experts:**

1. load trading data from all Russel 1000 tickers.

2. train AI on 500 randomly selected tickers (exclusive GME) to estimate the outstanding shares based on the trade data.

3. calculate the accuracy of the model on the remaining 500 tickers (excl. GME)

4. determine the outstanding shares for GME

5. repeat the procedure to test the robustness of the model

**Conclusion: MM, HF, banks create artificial liquidity by their market power in a legeal or illegal way (retail has no/little possibility to check it). The statistical analysis of GME clearly shows the deviations compared to other Russel 1000 tickers and proves that only MM, HF, banks have enough financial means and infrastructure to implement this. This manipulation is created by the artificial increase of the outstanding shares by a factor of approx. 10x. SHORTS DID NOT COVER.**",8232,u68nzl,2022-04-18T09:02:29Z,2022-04-18

Excellent work! It is clear that the underlying price movement is carefully orchestrated in an attempt to maintain institutional solvency; by using derivative manipulation with the ultimate intent of kicking the can.

DRS is counteracting their base driver of share dilution, and the result is ulterior tactics for share creation/dilution; be it through ETF manipulation or equity swaps.

Suffice to say, even IF they found additional methods for injecting synthetics into the market, those positions, (including the rolling deficits for activity prior to the button turning off), need to close in order for them to come out of this mess clean. And if apes continually buy & DRS, it then becomes mathematically impossible for them to exit without getting margin called.

If I may have suggestion: could you do the same analysis on LRC? The daily volume on several up days was above the total supply...rings a bell?..

And yes, you can have fake cryptos like you have fake shares. When you buy a crypto on a centralized exchange, it is possible you don't own the crypto but instead you just own an IOU with the exchange based on the value of the crypto. Hence buying this crypto would not exercise any upward pressure on the price. You would only own the crypto once you move it out of the exchange into a personal wallet.

My gut feeling is that something dodgy is going on with LRC. It would be great if you could replicate your analysis. Tks fellow ape.",6,u68nzl,2022-04-18T15:02:12Z,2022-04-18

5726,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,DD: Statistical analysis of trading data from GME shows that the outstanding shares are inflated by a factor of 10. SHORTS DID NOT COVER!,"/u/sdfprwggv This is amazing work. A couple of things that I think you should try to take into account and address in a separate post:

1. GME has a relatively small float. I'd recommend using this method to try to *predict* the float sizes of several other stocks with small floats to see if there is any issue with predicting small floats.
2. Relating to number 1 above, it would be nice to see an %error chart corresponding to the last chart in your post (minus outliers like GME) to judge relative effectiveness. Would be cool to see what other stocks don't line up (someone below said Popcorn is also off, so that is a pretty promising result.)
3. I think you solidly show here that retail is for the most part not driving price movements and volatility. However, regardless of where that volatility comes from, isn't that volatility the root cause of the gaps, and taking into account that GME has a small float, doesn't this basically skew/make your prediction off? I guess what I am asking is if there is a way for you to check for confounding variables.

Sorry if above comes across as really critical, but it is refreshing to see work with hard data like yours. I'd like this subreddit to regain a culture of DD with hard data which we peer review and discuss together.",2,u68nzl,2022-04-18T19:11:51Z,2022-04-18

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",2203,u66xvg,2022-04-18T07:00:12Z,2022-04-18

I have the daily chart candles up on my desktop computer, but I've been working on other stuff for the past few hours and just revisited the price now. This shit has to end, and the only way it's going to end is to DRS as many shares as possible. This is what I am doing personally, and it's only my opinion and not financial advice. I already have a direct buy account at CS. I did my first DRS this morning after taking a significant tax hit by DRSing shares transferred out of a broker IRA. I'm going to start the process to do the same thing tomorrow. I know what my tax exposure will be down to the dollar. I don't care if I have to sell my old ass body, sell my old ass sperm, sell plasma, sell my old ass underwear...whatever I have to do to pay my taxes. I'm getting every single fucking IRA share out of my brokerage and into a CS account. Again, do what suits your circumstances. Don't nessarily take my advice if it is not right for you.

5947,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"Just dropping these here, as I'd rather not make a whole thread just to share a couple of ideas. Potential NFT applications in game development:

**Backer rewards**: Early-access devs could partition X% of all future profits (let's say 5% as a ballpark figure) as a royalty split among backers above a certain tier. This serves a couple of purposes. First, it gives backers something tangible in the real world for having backed a project. Second (primarily for multiplayer games), it shifts the impact of backer rewards out of the ingame economy and into the real-world one - something that benefits both the people playing the game and the backers themselves, by removing real-world money from the game's ecosystem. As long as the game makes it, nobody loses.

**Bug/first-clear achievement bounties**: Setting aside the above use case (though something similar *could* function in this capacity as well), there's also the potential to reward users who crack troublesome bugs with unique NFTs. Let's say, for example, that there's a duping bug in a competitive multiplayer game that the devs can't seem to completely eliminate. A player manages to track down, replicate, and document the bug, and as a consequence, the developers are able to fix the problem at a mechanical level instead of just patching the exploits the mechanic is causing. 

That person's contributed significantly to the integrity of the game, and the devs *could* simply pay them a cash bounty. But why not give them a digital medal instead? Bugs can be famous (or infamous) in gaming history, and an NFT commemorating the resolution of such a bug could well appreciate in value like more conventional antiques. So instead, the devs could mint an NFT representing the bug, with the name of the player who gave them the critical report, and the date of resolution.",12,u66xvg,2022-04-18T07:54:14Z,2022-04-18

They are moving the prices of everything in their favor to survive another day.  

So at the beginning of the day, they needed to:
- Pump entire market to set up for today‚Äôs price drop. They can‚Äôt let the market drop quite yet. 
- Drop GME price while pumping market.
- Once stabilized the balance sheets, we can move on to the next phase. 

Once they have it balanced out:
- They can let natural market selloff‚Äôs play out. 
- But they need to drop GME‚Äôs price with the entire market. 

Any time there will be a market-wide selloff, they need to dump GME.

Any time GME has to go up and they can‚Äôt suppress the price effectively, they pump the market with it.",12,u66xvg,2022-04-18T16:45:48Z,2022-04-18

6210,gme,Superstonk,POST,Something pretty important from GME‚Äôs 10-K that I haven‚Äôt seen discussed here at all,"Alright, I kept waiting for someone else to post about this and it hasn‚Äôt happened yet so here I am, posting about it.

https://preview.redd.it/z94oj78a67u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd750e5684c0303297c3b18a64f0c7c4f724c3e1

There is a sentence on the first page of the 10-K that is basically a standard sentence that all 10-Ks have now, but it is so informative and a great reference for point, and also a great point of comparison to other stocks. Once you understand what it‚Äôs telling you, it‚Äôll jack your tits. Here‚Äôs the sentence:

>The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. (For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)

Let‚Äôs break that down.

**Voting and non-voting common stock:** *adding an edit here - non-voting stock can refer to a different class of stock (such as preferred stock) that does not offer voting rights, but GME doesn't have any class of stock issued other than the common shares we all own which do offer voting rights. End of edit.* non-voting stock is stock that you‚Äôve loaned out, so you no longer have voting rights. If you loan your shares and they are short-sold, the person who has purchased those shares now has the voting rights instead of you. Think Vanguard in the recent pre-proxy statement - they have 5M shares but don‚Äôt have voting rights. Those 5M non-voting shares would be included in the total in this statement, and because someone else now holds the voting rights in another account, they would then be included again as another 5M shares with voting rights. *Second edit here: there are a lot of comments calling this point I make about lenders holding ""non-voting"" stock incorrect because they say that non-voting stock only refers to other classes of stock that don't give voting rights, and therefore everything else I wrote must be incorrect, but I'd like to point out that the main takeaway and most important part of this post is* ***not*** *about non-voting stock but rather about the ""non-affiliate"" component of the above statement. Also, if the holders like Vanguard, who have filed 13 G statements with the SEC to show their holdings but 0 voting rights don't count as non-voting stock, what happens to them in this scenario? Are they just no longer included as holders? Or are they still included as holders but just under the ""voting stock"" category and therefore it doesn't change the rest of what's below? But as I said, that's not the important part of this post, focus on the ""non-affiliate"" part. End of second edit.*

**Non-affiliates:** anyone who isn‚Äôt an insider

**Why use July 30, 2021:** The end of the second fiscal quarter, which is what all companies use as a reference point in these statements

So basically this is saying that the value of the float shares (i.e. non-insider shares) they have on record as being owned on July 30, 2021 was $12.0B based on a closing price of $161.12. If you divide $12.0B by $161.12, you get about 74.48M shares‚Ä¶ but‚Ä¶ the actual size of the float on that date was about 65.17M shares. That means that 114.28% of the float was *officially* owned at that time.

https://preview.redd.it/8ackilij67u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c30f25d4a31d77dfd7f4b6fe73db4f1cfedd62

Well well well‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt that get more interesting all of a sudden!

‚ÄúNo, this isn‚Äôt interesting, we already know more of the float is owned than should be, and besides, this is just another bullshit number because the actual number of shares owned is way higher than that‚Äù Ok fine, yes, I agree with all of that. That‚Äôs why this post isn‚Äôt over yet.

I‚Äôm going to use a bit of a silly analogy here but hopefully it can help illustrate where I‚Äôm going with this post so please come along on this tangent with me. If you‚Äôve got a pretty good understanding of why counterfeit shares (AKA naked shorts) would easily exceed this number, you can skip past the weird monopoly game.

# Monopoly, but make it weird

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre playing monopoly, and the bank holds all the properties. You can buy properties directly from the bank until they run out of properties, at which point you can then only purchase them from other players who are willing to sell their properties.

https://preview.redd.it/0yia6a7t67u81.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=48033f7aed95a92c962462431150ca59d836db36

Now this player, we‚Äôll call him Mark, says ‚Äúhey Tom, I need some Monopoly money, let me borrow Park Place and sell it to Suzy, but don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll buy it back later and return it to you. I‚Äôll write up a contract with the bank so you know I‚Äôm good for it.‚Äù Mark is short selling monopoly properties. At this point, we could say that Park Place has two rightful owners, Tom and Suzy, but currently only Suzy gets to collect the money when someone lands on her space.

But what if someone decided to make this game of monopoly way more complicated and there are now way too many players, instead of buying directly from the bank or a player you now have to make all of your purchases through an intermediary (a broker) and you‚Äôre blind to what other players own and who you‚Äôre buying from.

[I‚Äôm actually a little surprised I found a picture for this.](https://preview.redd.it/btf2p89y67u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70bbdfda9075623f28910dc1700cff8913681b7)

The bank doesn‚Äôt get involved unless there are no players who can be traded with to buy or sell properties, or someone wants to write up a binding contract.

Mark, our property short seller from earlier, gets crafty and prints a whole bunch of fake copies of Park Place and starts selling them.

https://preview.redd.it/onaf6rr477u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb7322b4a7b4a8a3f895ddefe7f107681c836a7

Mark makes a shit ton of monopoly bucks on something that cost him nothing. It‚Äôs only a problem for Mark if someone lands on the space and now all of the owners of those fake copies are expecting to get paid rent. If Mark gets the money to the intermediary (the broker) to cover the payment to each owner, then no one needs to know what he‚Äôs done. The bank doesn‚Äôt know about any Park Place owners other than Tom and Suzy, since the others all received counterfeits that the bank doesn‚Äôt know about.

# End scene.

Alright, I hope I didn‚Äôt lose you too much during that fever dream of an explanation. Basically, the monopoly properties are shares of stock, Mark is a short seller, Tom is the lender, Suzy bought the shorted share, the properties that the monopoly bank knows about (Tom and Suzy‚Äôs) are the shares included in the 10-K statement, and the players holding counterfeit properties are the people who bought naked shorted shares, AKA counterfeit shares, and they are not included in the 10-K statement.

**Important note:** this is my understanding of how the data works in these 10-K statements and I would appreciate it if anyone can help confirm or deny that the counterfeits are not included in that 10-K statement. Or confirm where the values originate from - the transfer agent? The DTCC? I couldn‚Äôt find this info.

Anyway, back to why we care about this statement. GameStop has confirmed that on July 30, 2021 there were \~74.48M float shares owned out of a possible \~65.17M float shares, or in other words, there were 9.31M shares more (officially) than there should have been.

If only we knew what the financial media, with their access to premium data that they use so they can feel smarter than everyone else, was reporting as short interest back then‚Ä¶ oh wait, we do:

[This is for August 16, 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/w3xkwrye77u81.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=66c9d33eeb3fb8ec82f68484a78ae77444b3c6f0)

Based on his reported 10.67% SI of float, he‚Äôs using a float size of 63.17M shares. He also posted the data on July 20, 2021 which said 7.87M shares shorted (which he reports as 13.54% short interest of the float, meaning he‚Äôs working with a float of 58.12M). [Archive link for the Aug 16 tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220414020728/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1427338168412614659?s=21&t=mnlswCotXi_KAsQ-sKoOQg) and [archive link for the Jul 20 tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220414021059/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1417567467199770625?s=21&t=mnlswCotXi_KAsQ-sKoOQg). Just in case üôÉ

Alright, so his definition of float size has changed by about 5M shares in just under a month. Between July 20 2021 and August 16 2021, there were 0 insider transactions. Literally zero. There were also zero SEC filings from GME to indicate any changes to the number of shares outstanding during that time. So why the fuck did his float size change by 5M shares? And I‚Äôm not even talking about the S3 SI which for some reason includes the shorted number of shares in both the numerator and the denominator of the equation. I don‚Äôt have an answer to why his float size changed so drastically, I just wanted to point out how ridiculous it is.

So based on his little chart and his tweets, the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù number of shares shorted at the time was around 7.5M. We now know that according to GameStop‚Äôs records, at that time the number of excess shares was \~9.31M. How can you have more excess shares than shorted shares? Because mandated short selling reporting is all but useless and the number of shares shorted by financial media is bullshit, basically.

Guess that fancy S3 data isn‚Äôt so great after all‚Ä¶ I wonder‚Ä¶ who uses that S3 data?

[But obviously, we‚Äôre the ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù üôÑ](https://preview.redd.it/rv94w3wn77u81.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=788d80c3bca78e4ebf7a9509bd6df88590008339)

So if ever someone is trying to refute the GME short thesis because ‚ÄúBloomberg says \_\_\_\_‚Äù or ‚Äúbut nasdaq says \_\_\_\_‚Äù, you can point to GameStop‚Äôs 10-K and show them that their expensive data is garbage.

‚ÄúBut maybe it‚Äôs GameStop‚Äôs data that‚Äôs bad.‚Äù Yes, that‚Äôs a good point, maybe it is. So let‚Äôs do a quick check of some other stocks.

TSLA‚Äôs 10-K indicates 77.25M shares owned in excess of their official float on June 30, 2021 (TSLA‚Äôs official float was \~719M)‚Ä¶ S3 data says just over 40M shares shorted at that time, so once again it‚Äôs way under the reality. ([Archive link to July 1 2021 tweet with chart](https://web.archive.org/web/20220415184602/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1410711807984087042?s=20&t=1qNV7e2Q6DRciwZukEG14g))

The 10-K for üçø says 1.5M shares owned in excess of the official float on June 30, 2021, and S3 says 89.96M shares shorted (üçø‚Äôs official float was \~511M). [Archive link to July 1 tweet with chart](https://web.archive.org/web/20220415185504/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1410710310118256643?s=20&t=1qNV7e2Q6DRciwZukEG14g).

Wait‚Ä¶ what? That üçø one is‚Ä¶ backwards? Yes, it is. Now seems like a good time to explain that when a hedge fund is short selling, if there‚Äôs no one there to buy the share then market makers will just pick up the buy-side of that trade. If you think back to our monopoly game, it would be like the bank buying the property that Mark borrowed from Tom, cause it turned out Suzy didn‚Äôt want to buy it. A high number of reported shares shorted does not necessarily mean that there‚Äôs squeeze pressure if there‚Äôs just not enough buy pressure.

Interestingly, that üçø squeeze that ran it up to the $50+ mark started in late May and then started dropping back down in early July, right after the record date used for the non-affiliate ownership values likely made it so that the non-affiliate share ownership value increased a substantial amount right before that snapshot date that gave us a mear 0.3% excess üçø float shares owned. Maybe that‚Äôs a coincidence, maybe not.

[üçø OBV rises shortly before the June 30th ownership snapshot would be taken for the 10-K. It is currently a little lower than it was on June 30th.](https://preview.redd.it/cx21othw77u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b7f720d733a4bdd1aecd648c29fb9292d53ea14)

After taking a look at the recent 10-Ks for TSLA and üçø, I started to get curious about the historical ownership values. I also threw in a few FAANG stocks out of curiosity.

[These values are not all based on the same date because not all companies have the same fiscal quarter calendars, but this is at the end of fiscal Q2 for each stock for each of the stated years on the left.](https://preview.redd.it/rilalq8287u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7caa193bd73a236eff28dae23f1007f735a700)

Interestingly, TSLA, which has been undergoing a slow squeeze since late 2019, has seen a gradual increase in the excess number of shares they‚Äôve been reporting on their 10-Ks. This is an interesting point of comparison because the non-affiliate ownership of TSLA at the end of June 2019 at 3.6% excess (in other words, 103.6% of the float was owned), and heading into just under 5% a year later, was already building enough buy pressure to ignite a slow squeeze. TSLA‚Äôs Q2 ends at the end of June, and the slow squeeze started around early December of 2019. Even if we assume that they had already reached that 5% in early December when their slow squeeze started (but I suspect it happened later based on their chart), that‚Äôs still only about ‚Öì of the pressure GME had at the end of July 2021.

If the squeeze had really squoze in January 2021, why is the official excess float ownership still so high in July 2021? And just for fun, here‚Äôs a look at GME‚Äôs OBV since then to see whether that buy pressure has increased or decreased‚Ä¶

[GME OBV is even higher now than during the January sneeze.](https://preview.redd.it/yg9kzn4d87u81.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f4826e1da1aeeaa4d5f9f1f25d55dec3437923)

[GME OBV has also increased since that July 30th ownership snapshot from the 10-K.](https://preview.redd.it/da4qbtxi87u81.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=875f25d0f4f77a098ae2616d671d82d5492a0f56)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** hedgies are well and truly fucked. Even by ‚Äúofficial‚Äù data before you consider all of the counterfeit shares fuckery, the retail ownership of GME is astronomical.

&#x200B;

**Method:** for anyone interested in checking out other stocks to compare to this data, I used the non-affiliate ownership statements from the 10Ks, used total outstanding share counts from either 10Qs or proxies, depending on what was a closer date to the non-affiliate statement, and insider ownership from the proxies which I then added to or subtracted from (depending on timing) all of the share volume changes in the insider transactions found on fintel. I did my best to be as accurate as possible but the dates for the various data points didn‚Äôt always line up perfectly. Happy to share my Google sheet with anyone who wants to poke around in it.

&#x200B;

**Additional point of interest:** if even the officially reported non-affiliate ownership is already above the actual float, how will that play out for a GME stock split as dividend? Do they have to bring ownership levels back down to the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù level? I don't have an answer here, maybe something that someone else can shed some light on.

As a comparison, TSLA announced their 5 for 1 split in the form of a stock dividend on August 11, 2020, and the actual split occurred on August 31, 2020. On June 30, 2020 there were 7.0M excess shares, at just under 5% excess of the float, and ihors3 tweeted that there were 14.76M shorted shares that day ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220418013247/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1278066253207425025?s=21&t=JxJhN4FhvOpa8V_F3SdjAg)). Here‚Äôs a chart in case you‚Äôre curious as to what the price action looked like after that.

[Note that I‚Äôve adjusted the closing price to what it would look like if there had not been a split.](https://preview.redd.it/vxxxrcdn87u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab05b5145d8e4f307399f54de1e80955fe28c06)

Edit: There has been a few comments mentioning that the 5M difference in float size between ihors' July 20 tweet and August 16 tweet are because of the 5M additional shares issued, and yes that's most likely the case, but GameStop released the 8K announcing those 5M shares had been sold on June 22, almost a month before the July 20 tweet, and this data is being used by some pretty big sources so you would think they would be a little more up to date. Also, even after he's finally included those 5M shares in his August 16 tweet, his float size is still off by 2M shares which is pretty significant in an already small float.",8736,u62um8,2022-04-18T02:45:03Z,2022-04-18

I calculated current pessimistic share ownership at between 68million and 84million shares with some massive assumptions that 95% of all retail sold- which is very similar to your numbers:

6287,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Something pretty important from GME‚Äôs 10-K that I haven‚Äôt seen discussed here at all,"Some big issues

1) GME may not be including Cohen's shares in their calculation of the float as his shares are held indirectly. (See below.) This would bring the the float you calculated from the 10-K cover page of 74.5M almost exactly to Aug's 65.2M.

2) Your calculation of shares out from the cover page isn't what most people (and the financial statements themselves) use as it includes nonvested shares (see statement from the 10-K below). Did into the filings to see the actual shares used for financial calculations.

**This probably explains a lot of the discrepant numbers for the various companies.**

3) Yes, from July 20 to Aug 16 the **reportable** number of shares jumped approx 5M if you are drawing your data from the financial statements. 

**source for (1)**

> The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. **(For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)**

Further data points include RC Enterprises with 9.0M shares and Sherman with 1.3M. Neither are directors nor officers of GME. If included in float calculations, the 74.5M you came up with is reduced to 64.2M. If you take out the other former execs it is very close to the 

**Source for (2)**

> Shares of restricted stock granted by us are considered to be legally issued and outstanding as of the date of grant, notwithstanding that the shares remain subject to risk of forfeiture if the vesting conditions for such shares are not met and are included in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding disclosed on the cover page of this annual report on Form 10-K as of March 11, 2022. In accordance with accounting guidance, the financial statement presentation excludes unvested shares of restricted Class A Common Stock, as restricted shares are treated as issued and outstanding for financial statement presentation purposes only after such shares have vested and, therefore, have ceased to be subject to a risk of forfeiture. 

**Source for (3) from the various quarterly and annual filings**

> Shares issued and outstanding 69.3M as of May 1, 2021 (the latest number available in July) and 75.9M as of July 31, 2021 (the latest number available in August). An increase of 6.6M. If we include unvested shares, the increase is from 71.9M to 76.5M for a total of 4.6M",2,u62um8,2022-04-18T19:10:28Z,2022-04-18

> On March 31, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúGameStop‚Äù) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the ‚ÄúAnnual Meeting‚Äù) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 through an amendment to the Company‚Äôs Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the ‚ÄúCharter Amendment‚Äù) in order to implement a stock split of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock in the form of a stock dividend and provide flexibility for future corporate needs. GameStop also intends to request stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting for a new incentive plan (the ‚Äú2022 Equity Plan‚Äù) to support future compensatory equity issuances. If the 2022 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders,** it will replace the current GameStop Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the ‚Äú2019 Plan‚Äù), and 8,000,000 shares of the Company‚Äôs Class A common stock**, plus any shares subject to the 2019 Plan that expire, are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash after the 2022 Plan is effective, will be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. GameStop‚Äôs Board of Directors has approved both stockholder proposals, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval.

I could be wrong, but it reads to me that 8 million shares of the current 76mil outstanding are still owned by GameStop themselves?  Could be part of the missing 9.31million shares you're trying to find?",1,u62um8,2022-04-18T20:49:42Z,2022-04-18

>Anyway, back to why we care about this statement. GameStop has confirmed  
 that on July 30, 2021 there were \~74.48M float shares owned out of a   
possible \~65.17M float shares, or in other words, there were 9.31M   
shares more (officially) than there should have been.

GameStop has 74.48m shares outstanding which means the total shares that can be owned (by insiders and the rest) are 74.48m.

Also for what feels like the millionth time: **Stop. Looking. At. The. Float.**

Back in September, Yahoo Finance got data from the S&P saying that GME float was 251.4m shares.

Should we base all our calculations on that? Should we expect to DRS 251.4m shares? Of course not.

Compare it to other tech companies, like roku, spotify, shopify, block, uber, SNAP, airbnb, just to name a few, and you will quickly realise how undervalued GME is.

All those tech companies are worth way more than GME and in most cases make less revenue AND have more net losses. 
The way we value tech companies is like that. But GME is still viewed (and valued) by many like a retailer. 

Soon people will realise GME going into NFTs, web 3.0 and Metaverse makes it a tech company... one of the most well positioned in the fastest growing industries ever (NFTs/Gaming).

The mere fact that fucking Snapchat is worth 60b$ (5x GME) should be enough to convince you of how undervalued GME is right now.",142,u60ipr,2022-04-18T01:24:20Z,2022-04-18

Here's a summary from the 1st page. It's only 4 pages, everyone should read it. I don't know if it's been talked about on Superstonk.

‚Ä¢ A Bear Case ($304.00) tracking a delayed or thwarted NFT project launch alongside a plunge in the crypto sector due to potential regulation, industry average e-commerce growth with majority of sales deriving from brick-and mortar locations, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.

‚Ä¢ A Base Case ($498.00) that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, a successful but substandard NFT marketplace plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.

‚Ä¢ A Bull Case ($1069.00) based on an evolution into the ""technology company that delights gamers"" hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with early adoption of successfully implemented blockchain technology, a significant increase in revenue attributed to e-commerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.

With that in mind I believe if there was free price discovery we would see price \~3K$ with some clever accounting. Because the split is coming I would even remove the clever accounting. Basically valuations in Tech take the #users as the most important factor which I believe GME has the most devoted users/shareholders. 

If you think that 125K individuals from all over the world gone through the pain of DRS while see their money flying around wowww... and we did not even BLINK

&#x200B;

Some stupid math

* For me FMV is 3K \~ 225 B$ (crazy ha? maybe, I say not)
* Assuming valuation is 20x the revenue of the tech business -> 11.25B$ revenue needed
* 10K Gamestop claims that the nft market is 41B$ so you need 1/4 of that 
* You already have 125K investors which will explore / advertise / use the platform even if its early stages is crap (which it won't). With a solid base of users sky is the limit

For me this is couple of years down the road. If SHF was out of the way this is the price that I would say that my investment was a complete success story and I did not left money on the table if I would sell part of my holdings.

Basically this helps be zen in dips..

That will definitely change after the launch of the NFT Marketplace and whatever their plan with GMERICA is, whether for positive or negative.

However, as of this moment, they're a retail company with pretty much no debt, a promising board and C-Suite team, and some introspective ideas for the future of the company.

Whether they pull it off and evolve into a competitor for Amazon and other top tier companies is one we can only hope for. If they pull a Quibi then that would suck.

No matter how amazing the thought of digital resale market or cosmetic NFT market partnerships with massive brands are, if it isn't done correctly it will be done better by someone else. Let's up GameStop and RC can make it happen. If it goes well, I'd value it at $400.",-3,u60ipr,2022-04-18T08:12:47Z,2022-04-18

**TL;DR:**

* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"". (We may need to work backwards from which funds bought GME shares, and look more at long/short equity funds from the past 2 years.)**

For the culture: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u\_r7aLKWi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_r7aLKWi4)

So I recently got reported to Reddit Care Resources (only the 2nd time so far), and had no idea what for. Maybe it was this Puerto Rico comment here, repeating the fact that hedge funds fucked over post-Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico loading it up with shitty finance products because since they are a territory (and not a US state) their bankruptcy rules play to banks/hedge fuck's favor: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u5n8hp/bcg\_and\_puerto\_rico/i53zz84/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u5n8hp/bcg_and_puerto_rico/i53zz84/?context=3). (I responded that if that was the case then BCG/Citadel should eat a bag of syphilitic dicks.)

Or maybe it was a comment about BCG saying they're fucked hahhhddd

Either way, getting reported pissed me the fuck off.

SO here's my fuck you to whoever did it. Made me wanna research something to piss even more of you cunts off. Here's what I found.

Say hi to Boston Partners.

Patrick Regan (ex-Westfield Capital & Broadview International LLC) and Robert Jones (ex-Boston Company Asset Management) manage the portfolio for Boston Partners' Long/Short Equity Fund (mutual fund ticker: BPSLX). The fund deals with all caps (micro to large) and currently has 200+ equity holdings.

&#x200B;

**Now guess what one of them was back in Sept. 2021?**

**One of their largest short holdings was GME back in Q3 2021, making up 1.3% of their portfolio.** TSLA by comparison was 2.1%, but remember that's a huge large cap stock.

You can see their sector weightings too: consumer discretionary (where GME would prob fit) was 10.8% of their total short portfolio ([https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2021/10/ab3b476d750e375b6aab0cdd0e32bde8/bostonpartners\_longshort\_portfoliomanagercall-093021.pdf](https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2021/10/ab3b476d750e375b6aab0cdd0e32bde8/bostonpartners_longshort_portfoliomanagercall-093021.pdf))

Just kidding. This isn't the end of it.

We've seen Boston Partners before actually thanks to an awesome find by u/callmeputty back around last year on May 7th, 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6y6fh/gme\_ownership\_changes\_refinitiv\_eikon\_news\_may\_07/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6y6fh/gme_ownership_changes_refinitiv_eikon_news_may_07/)

>""Other institutional investors have also modified their holdings of the company. Seven Eight Capital LP **bought a new stake** in GameStop in the fourth quarter worth about $236,000. **Boston Partners increased** its holdings in shares of GameStop by 11.7% in the 4th quarter. Boston Partners now owns 85,058 shares of the company's stock valued at $1,602,000 after **purchasing an additional 8,915 shares** during the period.

&#x200B;

Now at worst, this doesn't seem like it causes anyone's eew eew llams to twitch but it does to me. And why the fuck is that?

&#x200B;

Because this ties into perfectly with what I saw with ANOTHER long/short equity fund, namely Cooper Creek Partners in my ""Irish Goodbye Pt. 2"": [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sy9u5v/the\_irish\_goodbye\_pt\_2\_quilters\_queeftastic\_qualm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sy9u5v/the_irish_goodbye_pt_2_quilters_queeftastic_qualm/)

* C**ooper Creek Partners had a ""long/short"" fund (just like Boston Partners above) that was short GME during the sneeze through a Morgan Stanley total return swap. Cooper Creek includes an ex-Citadel Surveyor Capital fucker named Joe Roskowski.**

&#x200B;

[Say hiiii Cooper Creek](https://preview.redd.it/niuu2hs766u81.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=c585f9018a3d411a145fc73bcf4fd99e2b381b19)

* After the sneeze, they reported that they ""covered"" (BUT NOT CLOSED) positions in that fund post-sneeze:

>‚ÄúAs part of our risk management, we covered approximately half of the position on 26 January and the rest on 27 January. **We also had two other short situations, which had become retail frenzy darlings and also experienced unprecedented moves due to the Reddit/Robinhood craze.

>  
>In addition to covering these names, we exited four more small-cap short positions and cut three additional small-cap short positions in half just in case the retail community went after them next. These short situations in aggregate cost the Sub-Fund over 6% in January.‚Äù

&#x200B;

* One of its Cooper Creek's biggest supporters who also INVESTED in said fund that was short GME was called Quilter PLC.

So Quilter PLC not only is a HUGE backer of this long/short fund that was shorting GME THROUGHHH the fucking sneeze, but then guess what they did a bit after? All credit goes to u/pdwp90 for finding that Quilter RANDOMLY bought 1800+ shares of GME last August 2021:

So why the fuck does this get me hype?

**Once (Cooper Creek Partners) is an anomaly, twice (Boston Partners) starts to be a fucking pattern. This now ends up being the SECOND time that not only was a long/short equity fund shorting GME through or after the sneeze, but then an associated party buys up GME shares around the same time.**

But what happened to Boston Partners' short position in Q4 2021? ([https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2022/01/5c52a346ee2d603222d9f33ea749aac0/bostonpartners\_longshortportfoliomanagercall-123121.pdf](https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2022/01/5c52a346ee2d603222d9f33ea749aac0/bostonpartners_longshortportfoliomanagercall-123121.pdf))

Gone. All of the same top short holdings are there, except for GME.

I've been going down this rabbit hole past few weeks (sorry haven't been posting as much as busy with shit!) but one of the angles I've been seeing is this

1. **We need to work backwards. We need to look at who has BOUGHT shares of GME as it may not just be them being bullish on GME but perhaps offsetting an invisible short position we don't know about (Like Quilter perhaps, who bought GME shares mid August then sold them right after)**
2. **We need to look at LONG/SHORT equity funds. Cooper Creek and Boston Partners are not the only ones that must have had not just short equity holdings (like Boston Partners) but also total return swaps (like Creek's with Morgan) on GME**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"".

Their Long/Short Fund was short GME back in Sept. 2021.","Well with all things,  it's important to look at the language as that's how technically illegal finance operations are made legal.  As we've noticed before,  but keep being told otherwise by msm, public figures,  misc others, I guess meltdowners, there is a clear difference between covering and closing/ exiting,  as referenced VERY clearly in these quotes.  

‚ÄúAs part of our risk management, we covered approximately half of the position on 26 January and the rest on 27 January. We also had two other short situations, which had become retail frenzy darlings and also experienced unprecedented moves due to the Reddit/Robinhood craze.

So. There it is. Not sure why it's still an argument in any sub. Just source the horses mouth so bear cases or just plain negative Nancy's can try to digest WHY a fund who was short would differentiate between how they managed a losing situation,  why they wouldn't just close/ exit, why would they leave them open if they sustained just a loss only to bleed more over time, and something else but I forget. 

I think this is one of the most important tid bits to note and think on vs majority of most information we've had in this sub.  This and why do brokers issue unofficial proxy numbers that don't work at gamestops official proxy,  or a web portal that issues no proxy at all.

6398,gme,Superstonk,POST,GME investor discount?,"Airlines very often in the 80s offered investors discounts on flights. 
It encouraged more investment in the company and more spending from customers leading to increased profits and return on investment. Win, win, win. 
Could GME offer something similar? I think it would encourage huge profit overnight whilst rewarding those supporting the company.

In addition it would encourage shareholders to hodl as the only way they can take advantage of the discount is if they keep holding their position.

6404,gme,Superstonk,POST,GME is a pillar of support while my life changes!,"It might sound really cheesy, but I need to get this off my chest.

Today, I moved 250km away from home to another country for my graduation internship. (I'm European if that wasn't clear enough lol) Now, I'm not one to be very dramatic. I've been away from home many times, but never when I had a stable relationship with my girlfriend. Pre-covid I went backpacking a lot and I met her just before the COVID sneeze. She dropped me off today and I miss her already, obviously, but I know I have to bear through it. The internship will be life changing for the both of us and she is so supportive! 

Now, I have never been so grateful for this community and GME. I'm so looking forwards to watching the ticker with everyone and read all the shenanigans on this sub. It even calmed me down thinking about it, been watching GME for more than a year and it has become my pillar of support. Takes away some anxiety and it takes my mind off things. Hedgies and MSM cannot take that away from me ever, they can bash us all they want, but we have created an awesome community that brings joy and support to everyone that lands in the sub.

Thank you guys, I can start this new period of my life with less stress and anxiety because of you! 

Sorry if this does not belong here. I needed to tell this to you guys, because I am sure this sub is a pillar of support to a lot of us.",85,u5ttik,2022-04-17T19:06:12Z,2022-04-17

6440,gme,Superstonk,POST,Interesting inside view from an Investmentbanker on GME üíéüíé‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è,"I‚Äôm a lawyer and I have a buddy from university days who moved to the dark side and has been working for investment banks for the past 10 years now with Nomura.
I obviously despised of his choice and was never shy of telling him but beside being a greedy bastard talented in making a shitload of money he is a really smart guy and overall a decent guy.

We live in different cities so don‚Äôt have frequent contact but when I met him last summer and was mentioning that I‚Äôm invested in GME I got the obvious talk. Basically he was laughing about me, saying that I should know better and that there is no way for individual investors to win against Wallstreet and I should say good bye to my money bla bla bla.

Now here is the interesting plot twist. When I met him again last Friday we naturally touched on GME again but his view has surprisingly changed.
Basically he was saying that in general his thesis stands that there is no way that individual investors would stand a chance against the monetary and lobbying power of institutions. For that reason the VW squeeze doesn‚Äôt fit as a role model as it was Porsche, a global company who screwed the shorters and not apes hence the situation can‚Äôt be compared.

Since Shitadel & friends have an unlimited tool box of screwing around and bending the rules and play countless shenanigans they could drag this staring contest out forever. Sure it costs them some money but they‚Äôll get it back tenfold by screwing over some other individual investors on other stocks. And obviously we shouldn‚Äôt base any hopes on the SEC and regulators to have any interest to intervene in the GME fraud since this is part of the game and would jeopardize the whole market game.

So the only chance to bring them down would be a catalyst which forces their hands.

And that‚Äôs what he thinks we just got with GameStop‚Äôs announcement of the split. He said any stock split could be a catalyst but even more so a split via stock dividend will inevitable create huge pressure and troubles for the shorties. He further went on to say the perfect storm would be if big players with enough fire power would create a gamma ramp by buying a reasonable number of options at any 10 bucks price point above 200 it would be very likely game over and highly difficult for shorties to stop the train once it‚Äôs moving full steam. 

And this time they wouldn‚Äôt dare to intervene by switching off buy buttons again or some similar shady stuff as they know they are under watch and that would create a turmoil.
He finished in saying everyone in the investment business is aware of the situation and closely following how this will play out and it is not unlikely that some players will want to take advantage and board the train.

Just some irrelevant jibber jabbers and obviously nothing new for us but I thought it‚Äôs interesting to share that change of view from someone from the dark side with my fellow apes and to share the joy that dumb money is on the verge to beat smart money üíéüíé‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è

[Edit: frankly I‚Äôm speechless how many people/comments are freaking out over the mentioning of options even though it‚Äôs just a side note of the conversation and it explicitly refers to INSTITUTIONAL investors and does by no means encourage any ape to buy options like it generally doesn‚Äôt encourage anyone to do anything at all.


But I guess as usual some people just always enjoy to pick on whatever suits them or their agenda‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt mind the impressive number of downvotes, whatever makes some of you happy, but seriously guys, so much negativity and hate from some people on such a harmless post‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just the irrelevant opinion of someone irrelevant shared by another someone irrelevant. 

To the vast majority of fellow apes though thank you for your kind support much appreciated - you deserve an epic MOASS üòé]",8755,u5klwf,2022-04-17T10:48:52Z,2022-04-17

You just try to f* the little guy more than what your competition does. However if yourself or your competition is underwater then this rule goes out of the window. GS did  this in '08, pretty sure that there are a lot of people that would like to hurt these guys. Once rumor, that some institutions are hurting badly, is out people would love to jump on board and buy the stonk.
Sadly SS has to do the work to push institutions underwater. Its a honor to have RC doing gods work trying to save healthy companies and expose crime.
Will this play out? Who knows... Odds were always against us... But this is more of a booster for APES... This info is what creates diamond hands... Against the odds with constant education and willing to investigate their desperate moves we are closer than ever. Noone talks about the conspiracy theories anymore.

Why would the authorities do anything because when they do they would screw themselves.
The only way this can get resolved is if the shorts are forced to close. Everytime the price goes up a lot they push it down, Everytime good news comes out they push it down.
I know MOASS will come, but what this whole thing has taught me is that usual catalysts for stocks don't apply to GME. We need something big and i think the stock split dividend might be it.

What sticks out was my question about the borrow rate. It was such a low rate, and yet so few shares had been available for such a long time. And it was still so heavily shorted (even if the SI% was lowered, I was essentially theorizing to him that they were naked shorting the stock etc., which, well, Citadel as a MM can do ‚Äúlegally‚Äù‚Ä¶others not so much‚Ä¶). He didn‚Äôt really disagree with any of that, but did make a point to state that naked shorting is illegal and that *he* cannot borrow a share unless he had a hard locate etc. (He plays by the rules of course.)

  
So, I was asking him what he thought about the borrow rate of the stock at the time, and why it was so low given that so few shares are available, and that the stock was clearly still being heavily shorted. 
  
He thought about it for a second and his response was essentially some hypotheticals: 
  
-	the first being rehypothecation. 
-	The second was that they had to give a *little* bit of a discount, otherwise people would just go to Goldman. 
  
(Cue scene from the big short in the ratings office). 
   
I do think he was simply trying to indicate that they have to offer rates competitive to their competition, etc., but my mind couldn‚Äôt help going back to that scene.

I also think it was a bit ‚Äòfunny‚Äô given goldman‚Äôs past experience getting caught shorting using the magical F3 key (IIRC this was documented in a FINRA violation). However, IIRC Goldman makes a TON of their revenue from shorting, more than most, so, again, this last part is all kind of anecdotal/theorizing/spitballing on my end.

Anyways, your post makes me wonder if I should ping him and ask him what he thinks about the share dividend‚Ä¶I just need to figure out how to word it since it‚Äôs been a while‚Ä¶",25,u5klwf,2022-04-17T13:13:41Z,2022-04-17

For now, Hedgies drop the price and then make the price go sideways, it's not because they're struggling to make the price go further down, it's because they're waiting for volatility to go down and load up on puts for cheap . Low volatility= cheaper option contracts. Hate it or not, a stock split can be the perfect catalyst to use call options and build a gamma ramp. I'm studying this shit and idk, buying calls for next week is retarded, but for June/July during the time the announcement is made seems like a strategy. You think you'll just end up giving away premium to hedgies? Options on low volatility can go for 2000$ to as low as 5$ depending on strike price, you thinks that's life changing money for a current hedgie on a multi-billion loss ?",4,u5klwf,2022-04-17T17:17:48Z,2022-04-17

But your banker friend has the EXACT same opinion as me.  I do not believe that we as individual investors alone can defeat Wall Street even though the squeeze fundamentals are sound - they are a behemoth with too much power.  We need some sort of a catalyst..

And you can look at my comment history; for over half a year I've been saying that we need some sort of a catalyst (DRSing enough shares is what I was using) and then the options ramp is the killshot.

Now we have a new potential catalyst, the stock split dividend - yet the killshot remains the same - and that is the options ramp up.

It absolutely is not an irrelevant part of the conversation. Without the ramp, we have far less leverage. The jan sneeze was caused by a gamma ramp before DRS was ever a thing. Peterfy says the options chain would have caused the price to go into the thousands if they hadn't turned off the buy button. WE NEED THAT AGAIN.

A lawyer calling an investment banker as to the darkside. That's ironic.


If the Finance Committee didn't result in any punitive action, the belief that some big players will take shorties out and Citadel is laughable.  They did it in broad daylight. They all pointed the finger at each other. They will do it again. And blame each other again. 


As soon as Citadel received the green light, KG was giving public intvs. As an attorney, you would know their team of lawyers green lit it.


Not only that. If you believe big players would force a squeeze, that would be market manipulation. Citadel would litagate the shit out of them.

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",1338,u5hjar,2022-04-17T07:00:10Z,2022-04-17

TA, gains, and GME aside; my proudest investments have always been in companies I believed in. Even when the company was currently horseshit and I only had fond memories of them I would still invest and fight management to turn the company around. 

Fuck Leon Cooperman and his ""Invest with your wallet, not your heart"" bullshit. Invest in companies you believe in, do your DD, and fight management if that's what it takes. All of these companies represent people working just like you and me. I'm tired of the media pumping rich megalomaniacs who can't stop shorting people's lives for a high score.

Then maybe a family member is like, ""You're doing the right thing, maybe sell some more just to be safe, in case this whole thing blows up on you."" 

Feels like a shill campaign. If you're gonna sell, then try to do it without telling anyone here. We're not going to care, because that sell pressure will make it cheaper for us to buy. Just saying to be weary of people talking about selling here. I'll sell my car (and then buy a cheaper car) to pay my taxes or buy food before selling my GME. **We are on the edge of MOASS, and if not, then a stock split dividend, bruh.

**Is there something in the Boston water? 1st State Street's XRT, then BCG, now meet Boston Partners! Their Long/Short Fund was short GME back in Sept. 2021.**

**TL;DR:**  


* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"". (We may need to work backwards from which funds bought GME shares, and look more at long/short equity funds from the past 2 years.)**",7,u5hjar,2022-04-17T23:19:35Z,2022-04-17

In which order do you think we'll see the following happenings?

- B) GME go up

- C) Other stocks (their short positions) go up

6889,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"Ultimately the question is: What happens after the Stock Dividend via Stock Split? Are hedgies fukd? Wen Moon?

This post was originally going to start out quite differently until I saw the post by /u/Cataclysmic98 a few days ago. I ended up revamping this a bit because Cataclysmic98 did a great job covering most of what I was attempting to do. Everyone go check out the latest post to get some background. Hopefully by now everyone has read GameStop's preliminary proxy filed on April 11th or at least gotten the gist of the good bits. 

My goal in this post is to outline some verifiable, reputable facts with GameStop's stock ownership and what will happen when the dividend is issued, sprinkled in with a bit of speculation at the end. I'll divide it into Part 1 (What We Know) and Part 2 (Speculation). I'm more than happy to edit or even delete the post if anyone debunks with more concrete info. The goal is to spread truth and shine some light on our upcoming situation. *Buckle Up* 

Let's start off with the announced stock dividend. [Typically, the issuing company (GameStop) utilizes their transfer agent (ComputerShare) to distribute the dividend. I'm sure this will be the case in our situation since GameStop has mentioned ComputerShare in their recent filings and the precedent set by Overstock utilizing ComputerShare to distribute their divided.](https://imgur.com/a/siz7jFv) The transfer agent distributes the dividend to Registered Shareholders first. The remaining dividends are then handed over to the DTC, which in turn forwards the dividends to the brokers who forward to the beneficial shareholders. In a perfect world, all beneficial shareholders will receive the dividend for each share they own before the ex-div date. But alas, if you're here reading this, you know this is a far from perfect world. 

[Per current Ortex data, there are a reported 21,270,000 shares of GameStop on loan as of April 14th.](https://imgur.com/a/CaMBKPS) Hmm... Who is entitled to the dividend if a share is loaned out? [Per the SEC, the shareholder is entitled to the dividend and the individual/company that shorted the share must pay the dividend to the lender](https://imgur.com/a/IuKmyjU)

[Per GameStop's Preliminary Proxy filed April 11th, Page 20, insiders + 5% owners hold 23,075,027 shares. RC Ventures owns 9,101,000 shares.](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/fa8db698-fa86-449b-bcd7-620e95db4d0d). [We also know from the 10-K on page F-17 filed on March 17th that 8,900,000 shares were Direct Registered with ComputerShare as of 1/29/2022.](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803). These numbers total just under 32 million shares, which leaves around 44 million shares as the free float. I couldn't find a definitive answer on whether or not Mutual Funds and ETFs were included in institutional ownership, so we'll just assume they are for ease. All that being said, none of us would be here today if we didn't believe this stonk wasn't naked shorted to the tits.",9,u5hjar,2022-04-18T02:19:15Z,2022-04-18

6967,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Cats? This is my miracle baby! Spent 3 weeks at the vet and cost me about 55 GME shares but she's totally worth it. Meet Twinkle.,"Anyone who's wondering:

She was given to me to foster and when she arrived I told the person that she was actively dying. Her breathing was extremely rattled and she could barely hold her head up.

Person told me she had an upper respiratory infection and was on meds. I took her immediately to the emergency center at the vet since it was 11pm.

Turns out she had pneumonia in all 4 lung lobes. The vet that was there said she probably wouldn't survive the night. To be honest, they were all really rude about the whole thing but after 3 weeks she was allowed to come home on continued breathing treatments 8x a day. She had to sit in a box that I would pump with some kind of vapor medication for her to breathe in. 

After a month of that she finallly stopped coughing and hacking stuff up. She's the cutest fucking cat I've ever had.

7002,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Both. I tend to invest in GME with income, but I also invest in other securities that I find are far undervalued or are long term dividend plays. The dividends were getting reinvested into their respective companies, but I started cashing them out and buying GME during it's downward trend. I know we're all about 100% in around here, but as long as the hedgies are playing in other parts of the market I'll keep fighting them on all fronts.

That being said, SPY/S&P have been on a downward trend all year. Could be a bear trap, it's definitely been lower YTD; but with the fed hikes confusing everyone future outlook looks bleak. I find a lot of stocks (Tesla, Chipotle, AMZN for examples) are far overvalued IMO; but as long as the feds keep pumping the market it doesn't appear to matter to anyone else. I've been closing out most of my other positions that aren't long term divvy holds in preparation for a recession. I'm even thinking about closing those out since GME is going to be offering divvies (Thanks RC!)

The problem I have with a lot of dividend companies is if we face a stagflation/deflation scenario the dividends may be removed; coupled with the possibility of a stock devaluation into loss territory for 5-20 years I don't want to be stuck in a long term losing position. Everything else, and I do mean *everything* else is going to take a very hard hit if we even hit just a recession. (GME long term and swap basket short term discluded, there's a few other outliers that may stay afloat as well)

Thanks for coming to my TED talk, I draw all of my TA charts with crayons and this is not financial advice",11,u5bx9k,2022-04-17T02:51:08Z,2022-04-17
7003,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Your only going to get mostly one response here.  Most are 100% GME.  Shorts did not close their positions last year, and the vast evidence since Jan 2021 shows they have only multiplied their short position. 

No hedge fund/analyst in the world seen the Gamestop fundamentals turnaround brought on by Ryan Cohen.  GME has become a win/win and will burn shorts to the ground.  They expected retail to give up on this play a loong time ago.  I feel confident saying that after all the fuckery exposed this past year,  most here would rather their position go to zero than sell and let these guys cover. 

My opinion?  We don't do financial advice here, but GME has huge short term upside with June split vote and mass buy in if split is expected 7-1, and huge long term potential with the platforms currently under construction.   I'm personally 90%+ GME.  Not 100% because i recieve bi-weekly company stock for my own employer. Would be 100% if that was not the case.",8,u5bx9k,2022-04-17T03:13:28Z,2022-04-17

7049,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Not financial advice but Yes.

Think about it in terms of Market Cap, and what you are trying to accomplish (50%, 100%, 200% etc). AAPL is around a $2.7 TRILLION Market Cap at the moment. So for you to double your money on that investment (100%), AAPL Cap would have to grow by $2.7 Trillion. Definitely possible, but how long will it take? 10 years?

Now look at GME little $11 Billion Market Cap, which many could make the case that this will be a $100 Billion+ Market Cap stock within a few years (with or without the Sneeze). IMO it‚Äôs much higher of a chance we see $100 Billion MC in a short period of time with GME, than we will see $5 Trillion+ Market Cap with AAPL.

TLDR: your chances of doing 1000%+ gain on GME are much higher than your chance of ever seeing 100% return on AAPL based on Market Cap alone.",2,u5bx9k,2022-04-17T05:03:08Z,2022-04-17

I was in PLTR, LCID, Z, TAP, and GIS at various points along with GME and closed them all out around November when the initial DRS numbers came out which along with the Avanza numbers convinced me that there were probably 30 to 50 million shorts in possession of retail over the float and reported short interest. I put that money into GME. TAP, GIS and LCID we're winners for me, PLTR was a break even, Z was a loser.

I was just browsing the internet to see when was the last time **one of the finest investors of his generation** filed a 13F on GameStop. Initially, I couldn't find anything, but the moment I entered $GME's CUSIP, this website popped up: [https://13f.info/manager/0001628110/cusip/36467W109](https://13f.info/manager/0001628110/cusip/36467W109) 

For the ape's who don't want to click the website, here is what you see:

In fintel, all Melvin's GME position is locked (I ain't paying for that). Also, they show a -100 with a File Date of 2021-05-17.

The scary part is that Melvin had around 6 million puts (I couldn't find any calls)  in 2020 Q4. So at Gamestop's January peak, Melvin was down $1,950,000,000 ? If not for Kenneth Griffin and Steven Cohen, Gabe would've been really screwed.",116,u5axdj,2022-04-17T00:15:41Z,2022-04-17

I may update this in the future. Thank you to anyone I forgot to mention that had also discussed Aladdin but forgot to credit.

Quick update
For the record I am not a software or networking guy and even though I tried to learn more about their system with the University video provided I would rather defer to apes who specialize in that. This is probably nothing but still felt it was worth taking a chance brining attention to it.

Many software products are produced with a benign intend; Bringing information together, turning it into a consistent whole, allowing easy dissection of the data, verifying it against benchmarks, nicely presenting the results, etc, are all simply tools to facilitate end users, making their jobs easier, getting accurate results faster.
Up to this point, nothing much seems wrong with that.

But the same tools will likely also have issues like privacy concerns, security, authorisation and authentication requirements, journaling and other stuff that could easily go wrong (without ill intent). And even worse (but nearly impossible to control by the producer) is when such software tools are used for questionable applications, with objectives that could cause harm instead of help - THAT'S when problems start.

So, when problems do arise, the human element is often much more important than the actual software itself. Just saying.",2,u56jxl,2022-04-17T14:43:34Z,2022-04-17

7162,gme,Superstonk,POST,"GME Floor website hits $100,000,000 on DFV day? Probably nothing.","However, the price still needs 1 more digit to be a standard US phone number, and 4 more digits after that to encapsulate the largest country code/region code (44-XXX is the country code for Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man - I‚Äôm leaving out 44 as that is the UK code). 

Then obviously I have to double that to account for taxes. That‚Äôs $20,000,000,000,000 (20 trillion) dollars. So we are at 0.000005% of that today. 

According to the global economy value infographic, the total value of the global economy (including derivatives) is $4,200,000,000,000,000 (4.2 quadrillion). 

$20 trillion is ~0.0048% of $4.2 quadrillion. 

If my math is right, which is doubtful, the entire global economy (including derivatives) is worth a whopping 210 shares of GME.

7212,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,"18k gains in April (BABA, AMZN, TWTR)","[All aboard the gain train.](https://imgur.com/a/NBityhG)

About 18k in gains since the beginning of this month. Felt like I actually was patient with my entries and saw through the noise on these trades. Already withdrew 10k for Roth, boomer brokerage, savings, and taxes. This is more money than I make in about 3 months of work, so this has been awesome.

**BABA 4/8 115c +$2,375**

(Bought at EOD and got a gap up the next day, sold at open).

**AMZN 4/14 3010c +$9,532.50**

(Bought this EOD last week when it was near 3000 because I like round number psychological supports. Moved up to 3120 the next day. I could have held out for about 10k more in gains, but oh well).

**TWTR 4/22 46p +$6,060**

(Opened these yesterday because TWTR talk was at a fever pitch on WSB/StockTwits, which means it's time for puts. Through everything I read, there's no way Elon's making this deal happen, he's the ultimate troll.

Most powerful people want Money, Respect, and Influence. Twitter represents Influence.

Twitter represents the public square, if you control twitter you have enormous influence on what the public is thinking about. If you control what someone is thinking then you control them.

Elon understands this, some other big money players understand this, twitter employees understand this. It's now just a matter of how many of them are willing to convert their Money into (control over) Influence.

I trust Elon on this. I don't begrudge his ability to make some sick money while fixing twitter, and I think his goal is to fix twitter.",2,u6unxr,2022-04-19T16:52:45Z,2022-04-19

Because even if Elon doesn't decide to buy, he has to keep his offer up for a bit to remain credible.

And every Tweet he makes will continue to make bulls feel he is interested; placing additional upward momentum.

Almost half a million views

This brilliant man here broke down the legal side [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u5010c/the\_poison\_pill\_effectively\_steals\_from\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u5010c/the_poison_pill_effectively_steals_from_and/)

TL;DR

Anyone or groups crossing the 15% boundary would get diluted into infinity and the courts have already widely accepted this as 'not *ultra vires.* ' meaning it **is within one's legal power**

The DOJ and SEC are going after Musk already

The media and side-ies are ramping up anti-Elon propaganda, and have been for months.

This was exactly why.

**If you are a twitter bag holder you only really have one hope imho, and that's someone they trust (like maybe Bezos?) steps in (probably unlikely),** also maybe Twitter finds a backer to take themselves private or some other mysterious shit.. also bad for Twitter (as was Elon ever being serious or trolling about touching anything there)

This would fuck your puts but the risk/reward looks great

# If I Gave You A Coin That Pays You 3:1 How Many Times Would You Flip It

In my strongest of opinions, Twitter is a 5th gen weapon and it will be salted and scorched Earth before ever being turned over.

Employees quit/fired/boycott and evacuated before building demolished, servers destroyed and wiped, logo trademark sold, and the ground burned and salted. Then Elon is smeared as bad or worse than Mango himself along with the company name. Then the only thing that would ever be turned over is the name. Twitter. Share price infinitively diluted and reversed split to 0bid - 0.01 ask.

Cellar Boxed and burned

# One More Update

Elon is teasing Tender offer, this may ensue more aggressive scorched Earth approach in the near term worries for massive dilution if they are in fear of him seriously getting too close.

Elon may just trigger the Pill for the lulz on 4/20 (weds)

**It is your WSB duty to tell every retard you see that is clueless, that they are getting diluted and diluted more if they are buying a dip in hopes of out bidding an infinite poison pill and/or scorched Earth provision.**

I still see people not getting it. We'll get there before premarket Monday.

See you at the bottom

7361,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,TWTR Poison Pill? Buy the Dip - an alternative viewpoint based on Naked Short Selling.,"A lot of posts are developing on WSB that TWTR Puts is a play. I believe the opposite is True.

My Reasoning: The US Stock Market is driven by **unregulated Naked Short selling** and tech companies are a prime target for price control and pinning. Aside from Insider Trading, these two forces should be used to determine price movement post announcement.

&#x200B;

# ASSUMING NAKED SHORT SELLING IS A MARKET FORCE:

For TWTR's 50% discount Poison Pill - the effect is simple, naked short sellers need to buy shares at market, or increase their leverage to provide additional shares to buyers, or ~~close~~ cover their naked short positions.

This move **kills 3 birdies with one stone:**

1. It prevents TWTR from hostile take over.
2. Increases share price.
3. Wipes out Naked Shorts.

# Buy the Dip Tards - Watch CTB (rises with naked covering)

Edit: I personally am waiting for Elon to boost his position to 14.6%, and CTB to rise to 10%, or a -10% dip in share price.",0,u56s0v,2022-04-16T20:44:16Z,2022-04-16

7363,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,TWTR Poison Pill? Buy the Dip - an alternative viewpoint based on Naked Short Selling.,"A poison pill isn't a stock dividend, it's the dilution of your stock to avoid a hostile takeover.

Even if naked short selling is something that drives the market (which in itself is highly questionable/debatable), please explain to me how Twitter diluting their own shares would hurt naked short sellers?

The argument for puts is that the poison pill being triggered, or even the threat of the poison pill, will likely drive the stock price of Twitter down.

The argument against puts is that Elon raises his offer (which he clearly stated he won't do in his initial offer), or some outside group gives a rival bid higher than Elons initial bid.

I just genuinely don't understand the rationale of your argument to go long on Twitter due to the poison pill because of supposed naked short selling.

$   24B Collateral value of Twitter (assuming GS 12-month price target of $30/share)

What you have to realize is that the majority of elon musks net worth is tied up in TSLA shares. He sold around 16 billion in TSLA around the end of last year. He then used that to purchase his stake in twitter. A lot of twitters stock is tied up with institutions as well.  I personally think that he doesn't have the money to buy it. He simply put twitter in a situation where there market cap will be reduced due to them implementing various strategies to avoid a hostile takeover. This could allow him to buy even more of twitter at a discounted rate as institutions pull out in fear of their investment losing money.

7400,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,$TSLA and $TWTR and TSLA earnings - Hear me out here,"So earnings are coming up this week for TSLA.. Elon Musk's entire net worth is really in the stock of his companies (TSLA and Space X)...

The offer to buy out Twitter can only happen if 1 of 2 things happens:

* Elon Musk sells his stock in TSLA (and owns less of TSLA going forward); or
* Elon Musk uses his stock as collateral to leverage some massive level debt in order to buy Twatter.

Lets assume he uses his TSLA stock as leverage... I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122. They probably got a peak, were happy with what they saw and were good with him putting an offer forward for the 43 billy for Twatter because the stock (what he'll use for collateral) will continue to rise in value going forward PRIOR to Q122 earnings date.

Am I reading too much into this and going full tard or am I making sense? Are my TSLA 1050 5/20 calls going to print?",1,u55db3,2022-04-16T19:35:11Z,2022-04-16

7446,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,A Guide To Help You Understand How Fucked Twitter Is - $TWTR,"**Not financial advice**

Ok so I know a lot of you have been following my Twitter Hindenburg posts

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tztelv/twitter\_is\_the\_hindenburg\_elon\_is\_the\_flame\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tztelv/twitter_is_the_hindenburg_elon_is_the_flame_you/)

So now after reading the first post about how bad the fundamentals are and the second about how bad it would be for twitter

Now that we've gotten two updates

# First is

Elon made a tender offer then was essentially rejected

Twitter's board voted unanimously in favor of the poison pill option

What does this mean?

>Such plans allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of any new, hostile party  
>

>Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other means.

My understanding is they can either dilute the stock by offering themselves a discount on 200M shares per enactment

Or there is disproportionate dilution (the bigger your holding the faster up your ownership% goes, the smaller the faster % down it goes)

Yes this means it's impossible for Elon to buy Twitter or retail because you will be diluted into the abyss

This is a **death spiral on a poison pill enactment** .. if Elon backs out it could crash the price and more hostile take over worries ensue.

But it gets even better

# Second update

Musk is looking to team up with other people to buy 14.9% to not trigger the current pill

TWTR planned for this

You'll notice a lot of companies have more shares at least (2:1) authorized compared to outstanding, this is going **scorched Earth** to prevent a take over

Twitter was really scared of this possibility, so they have authorized 6:1 (3 times higher than a normal contingency) just in case it seems

Edit: another commenter said this

>  
>You fucks really act like corporate lawyers haven‚Äôt spent their entire careers in m&a and with 40 years of poison pills to be worked around that easily lmao.

&#x200B;

Yes that means that if Elon goes that route Twitter is prepared to **self immolate**

This is going to get juicy

You think the SEC and DOJ are going to help retail investors?

They are already going after Musk

The MSM and bagholders etc. are posting memes about you buying it up and handing it over

That makes zero sense and it's a grift.

&#x200B;

Touch twitter if you think there's a small chance another 'dark' entity swoops in and Twitter lets them buyout to save this PR nightmare

Otherwise June 20p are looking hella spicy

Tell your friends how the death spiral mechanics work

# The Death Spiral

The timing is anyone's guess , but more importantly this conversation about it is evolving quickly and retail and the public is understanding the risks and outcomes more quickly everyday. **Long  Holiday Weekend ahahah**

This could cause share price panic to ensue which crashes prices which may accelerate take over worries resulting in near term drastic actions to oust Elon via dilution at all costs

This creates a positive feedback cycle crashing the price and diluting it more

Requiring reverse splits just to stay listed with the amount of shares being dumped from dilution MMs and emergency meetings... a short seller paradise. Regsho exempt naked short selling with the promise to return on issuance

TWTR is really about to start trading a like a fat cap penny stock

We see this a lot on tickers too small for this sub

You get to witness something special here to today

# TL;DR

Twitter gets diluted infinitely to avoid take over

Retail is getting griftied because they don't understand

Jun 20p and small size incase some mysterious buyout offer comes from TWTR buddies

&#x200B;

Questions:

Can you go into further detail on disproportional dilution? I can‚Äôt find anything that‚Äôs not super complicated (sorry am noob). Who decided where that‚Äôs at and what that‚Äôs going to be?

Can you explain authorized:outstanding and where I might find that for random companies I look up on a day to day? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs the 10k?

My read based on context is that for every current share on the market Twitter is ready to print 6, 200M at a time? (Poison Pill indeed!)

The Par Value has me confused ([reading up on it](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp)) - so they *sell them* to shareholders at $0.000005 but they‚Äôre worth current price? So it‚Äôs like free money to incentivize everyone to buy? No one is giving their money *too* Twitter?

7499,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,A Guide To Help You Understand How Fucked Twitter Is - $TWTR,"This is my take on Twitter since I only just began using it a year ago. I really didn't want to, but to see what some investors were saying I decided to give it a chance.

My first impression, right out of the gate was this is so trash. The user interface is garbage and felt awkward to use. Randomly suggested people to me whose opinions I give zero fucks about. Even the people I follow, the way to view new posts take forever and navigating the app is trash.

Just my 2 cents, but if Elon were to create his own social media with a better interface with free and subscription based services like he planned on with Twitter, I bet it would take off. Free speech is valuable. This would crash Twitter a lot faster than trying to take it over or working with a scummy power hungry board. It will just end up like Myspace if a better product comes out.

Elon can just do what he's best at. Innovate and create a far superior product.",12,u4lznp,2022-04-16T02:35:27Z,2022-04-16

3. Afterwards, you can buy puts if you think this counteroffer will fail too and that Musk ultimately becomes disinterested.

I think OP is kind of retarded if he thinks the board will intentionally sabotage their company via mass dilution out of spite.

The truth is that Elon made a lowball offer, and I believe Elon feels this way too. He might have intentionally made this lowball offer because it publicly gets him an easy out on selling his investments at a gain (essentially a pump and dump). Or maybe he did this as part of some 3D chess move that ultimately leads to Twitter being acquired. But I am too retarded to understand what potential 3D moves there are to be made.

7578,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,Puts locked and loaded? D-Day dilution inbound for TWTR!,"The board [approved](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-adopts-limited-duration-shareholder-rights-plan-enabling-all-shareholders-to-realize-full-value-of-company-301526627.html) the Shareholder Rights Plan (aka ‚ò†Ô∏èüíä) earlier today.

Key takeaway: Under the Rights Plan, the **rights will become exercisable if an entity, person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Twitter's outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board**. In the event that the rights become exercisable due to the triggering ownership threshold being crossed, **each right will entitle its holder (other than the person, entity or group triggering the Rights Plan, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, additional shares of common stock having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the right.**

2Ô∏è‚É£Elon snags >15% of the company? Stonk goes down.

7580,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Puts locked and loaded? D-Day dilution inbound for TWTR!,"Note that although poison pill sounds bad for shareholders, it actually does not necessarily will deflate the stock price. Remember the world is not static and different actors will react to the poison pill plan. Remember dilution only happens if the triggering event happens. And the whole point of adopting the poison pill plan in the first place is so that the harmful effect of dilution will only affect the triggering party, ie. the activist investors, while sparing all other investors.

Netflix adopted a poison pill plan on Nov. 2, 2012 in response to Icahn's potential hostile bid. Its stock price subsequently rallied as much as 20% within days.

He should sit quiet for a couple days. Let the market worry. The stock declines - there will be lots of volume. Accumulate on dip up to 14.99%


2. Then tender for the whole thing at $69.420. They would have to put that to vote. OR - he can trigger the poison pill. Call their bluff. They flood the market with shares. Wouldn't current holders want to short if they have a right to buy at $22.50? Whole thing backfires.

7649,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,Lawyers representing Twitter shareholders are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. The investment bank predicted that TWTR shares would continue to decline in value over the next 12 months. After the board hired Goldman to advise them they are claiming Elon's offer is way too low!,"When the Twitter shareholder lawsuits begin the class action lawyers are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. Just two months ago [Goldman's Equity Research](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514726980909948928) team predicted that Twitter's share price would decline from $37.83 to $30.00 over the next twelves months and recommended their clients SELL the stock. This week Twitter's board hired Goldman Sachs to advise the board on Elon's $54.20 offer. Goldman is now [claiming](https://www.unseenopp.com/goldman-advisors-say-no-deal-to-musks-twitter-bid/) that Elon's offer was ""***too low to be taken seriously***"" despite that it is 81~~57~~% higher than their own price target for the stock. To be clear, I am not saying that GS will face any liability for their conflicting opinions but when the shareholder lawsuits come the lawyers will have a 'field day' deposing the research group and the advisory group. I am sure they will have lots of excuses - but they ever get in front of a jury it will be fun. I didn't realize how upset so many people would get by pointing this contradiction out.

There are ‚ÄúChinese walls‚Äù between both departments for ethical and regulatory reasons. This is the way for ALL investment banks with equity research/brokerage functions. 

Why? Think of it this way: the investment banking division works with material, nonpublic information all day long. IPOs and upcoming M&As are the very definition of material nonpublic information. The brokerage cannot know about that before the rest of the public. In fact, the brokers/equity analysts shouldn‚Äôt talk to the investment bankers at all ‚Äì especially in a work context. If they do, and they write about what they learned, they can be sanctioned by the SEC. 

Another way of looking at it is you wouldn‚Äôt want Goldman research to just shill their investment banking deals ‚Äì they should provide investors with independent advice that will make them money. 

It looks bad, but that‚Äôs the nature of investment banking. If anything, it actually shows that Goldman‚Äôs equity research is truly independent.

7729,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,TWTR acquisition price analysis/opinion,"The recent offer that Musk make for acquiring Twitter (TWTR) made me dig into what I would consider a reasonable price for the buyout. My initial thought was that Musk is very aggressive in his ""take it, or leave it, I'm not negotiating, offer for $54.20 per share"" and the offer honestly seems low. Why do I think so?

Musk is making an offer based on a daily price as two specific points of time - the day he purchased his 9.2% share and the day he disclosed it - but usually such offers are based on average stock price over a more extended period of time. Take Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATV), for example. Microsoft is paying a large premium over current price at the point of announcing the deal (close to 50%), but they are also paying a premium over the price on a MA200 basis. MA200 on January 14th has been at $81.23 despite recent downslide, which means Microsoft paid 17% premium on an MA200 basis, and also offered a price ($95 a share), which is below, but still close to 52-week high ($99.46).

**Summary** (MSFT acquisition of ATV)

* **17%** premium over MA200 price (**$81.23**)
* Price (**$95**) below but close to 52-week high (**$99.46**)

Now where is TWTR compared to that. As of April 14th, the MA200 is at $52.14 and the 52-week high is at $73.34. Elon's offer is mere 3.95% premium on the 200-day moving average and is way below the annual high. If we take the same % premium Microsoft was willing to pay, the price tag must be at at least $61. If he's really willing to pay 30% premium, then the price should be $67.78. This is still below the 52-week high, but would be a reasonable and acceptable offer for the shareholders.

**Summary** (Musk offer for TWRT)

* **3.95%** premium over MA200 price (**$52.14**)
* Offer (**$54.20**) way below 52-week high (**$73.34**)
* Acceptable offer at **30%** premium over MA200 is **$67.78.**

7741,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,I figured it all out. Elon and TWTR.,"Social media market is at it's lowest and pretty fragmented. Musk is bored and wants to have some fun (and cash).

What better way to get in the play then:

1. Ask in a poll weather social media needs a new platform that actually tells the truth
2. Receive the expected answer from your followers
3. Pretend to want to buy the platform so that you can change it to be the ONE
4. Fuck with the SEC in the interim (this is a very welcomed bonus for him and for all of us as well)
5. Fuck with the board of the company by pretending to joining the board only to let them know in a message you were actually trying to buy them out
6. Increase the value of your shares in the process by making a financial offer that they need to refuse and start looking for potential other buyers for a higher price while under the gun that if they don't accept it, you will lower the stock price by just offloading what you bought earlier (again lovely fucking with the SEC)
7. Sell out in a profit while having fun and a good laugh
8. Announce after liquidation that a new platform was cooking under, is ready and you just need to pay 2 USD / month to get on board. Watch TWTR, Snapchat, TikTok and Meta share price collapse.

Remind me in 6 months!

I find it amazing that nobody realizes the real proof there is already free speech is the fact he was allowed to make all this (yet) unrealized profit  and then just get away with a small fine. Good boy SEC.",15,u425hv,2022-04-15T06:56:20Z,2022-04-15

Elon has been making a lot of noise of late about being a 'free speech absolutist'. If he buys Twitter, he's obviously going to restore Trump to the platform under the guise of 'free speech'. 

The right will praise him as literal Jesus. The left with lose their minds, but he'll counter with 'this is just about free speech, not politics'. 

He'll probably sell loads more Teslas and Starlink systems. And he'll have a powerful political ally in Trump.

7866,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Mark Cuban thinks Elon plans to sell $TWTR for a profit,"I think Elon knows Twitter is going to deny his offer. Once they do Elon will announce he sold his shares and Twitter will tank 50%. Musk will announce that he‚Äôs now buying MySpace or starting a competing platform. Twitter will tank some more. Once all of this occurs there will be class action lawsuits against the Twitter board for incompetence and not prioritizing shareholders. Musk will then expose Twitter for being mostly bots that are controlled by corporations and governments to disseminate propaganda. That will be the final nail.

Edit. 

Because people like this comment, I will clarify a bit about why I think this is a real possibility. 

THEY ARE FORCING HIS HAND if they reject his offer. He‚Äôs not going to sit on billions in shares of a dying company, who‚Äôs board just said no to an unbelievably good deal.

ELON IS WILLING TO BUY IT. He could easily revive Twitter. But he knows they won‚Äôt sell. Twitter will not sell because they are an asset of the deep state. 

Where it gets real.

Elon will start a competing social media. Half of the population will flock to It. While Elon and his platform are shunned by the other half. Increasing government overreach akin to Shanghai occurs. Elon‚Äôs platform is the only place to freely discuss it. Elon deemed a terrorist. Users of Elon‚Äôs platform deemed terrorists as well. US government pushing for civil war by various means; mass arrests, armed checkpoints, restricted travel, lack of food and water. While countries around the world offer to send soldiers to the US to quash the rebellion that isn‚Äôt actually occurring (a few shootings but no war). Iran, China and Russia side with the US patriots and make compelling speeches about liberty, but patriots are convinced it‚Äôs an act. 

On the brink of war a highly televised and very violent fake alien invasion occurs. One man distinguishes himself by seemingly supernatural means during battle with the aliens and through the subsequent days. I think he will speak to each person individually, like in their head. This will not really be supernatural, but part of a carefully constructed plan dating back decades. Nano tech currently being dispersed worldwide via airplanes, as self-assembling microfilaments (the cause of morgellions) will be the means by which he speaks to each person. I think this will happen while he‚Äôs giving a speech, after defeating the aliens in some way. This speech will be the most viewed live event in the history of television by a large margin. The job of each government after the chaos of the invasion will get the power back on and to get people in front of their televisions to watch the speech. He will say the perfect thing to each person (based on data collected from each person while internet browsing). He will then claim to be God (not the God of any earthly religions but the real one) and most will accept him as God (they‚Äôve seen evidence). 

Check out revelations if you‚Äôre interested in the rest of the story. Thanks for reading if you got this far! It was fun typing. BTW there ample evidence for the Morgellions/planes/nano bot thing.",1547,u3mft7,2022-04-14T18:15:44Z,2022-04-14

7955,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Mark Cuban thinks Elon plans to sell $TWTR for a profit,"hey Mark? what's worse than an idiot with an opinion?

A) 

An idiot with money to buy a sports team but doesn't think about consequences 

Elon has the money so he was locked in that offer UNTIL the offer is either accepted or flat rejected (a flat rejection being ""there's no way further offers will be fruitful"") because if he makes offer then cashes out that's against the law (aka "" Pump & Dump"" what is what Cuban's possibly libelous accusation is suggesting)

Instead, Elon has a beautifully choreographed path to either let Trump back into the tweeter-verse OR take a few billion$ from AMERICAN-HATING LEFTISTS.

the (illegal, due to fiduciary  responsibilities) ""offer"" of instituting a poison pill thus rejecting Elon's offer flat now allows Elon to dump without warning and possibly even gain 14.9% stake by re-buying at the lower price (after the dump brings price closer the suggested $30 value)

if Elon does re-buy a dump... (he'll limit it to 14.9% to prevent the poison pill from kicking in)  look for  A LOWER OFFER and the resulting lawsuits due the fiduciary duty to have voted on the higher offer instead of scuttling it.

after that?

if after dust clears and still no positive result(for Elon), i expect Elon will dump all again (and maybe later buy to just under minimum report level)",2,u3mft7,2022-04-17T13:42:34Z,2022-04-17

7989,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Goldman advised Twitter not to accept $54.20 a share but they have a price target of $30 for $TWTR,"After the 2008 housing crash... does any sane person take Goldman Sachs advice seriously? How do they even have any credibility.  They have been kicking other tech companies to the curb too... see their rating history on AMD... if you took Goldman's advice you would be poorest fuck on the planet, the fact its a revolving door between Goldman and the Fed for Sr leaders should be ringing alarm bells.

Its basically open knowledge that they peddle poison pills intended to let them steal your money. I can't believe that re-animated zombie of a bank was bailed out by 10 billion tax payer money and has the nerve to tell us how capitalism should work. they got a bigger bail out, then the $2.4 billion fine they had to pay for the derivatives they sold in unregulated markets.

People voted with their wallets, Goldman's slight of hand scheme backfired, and they should have bankrupted or been sent into irrelevance operating a handful local county branches in some backward state. I am all for capitalism its supposed to work by killing off unproductive useless leeches. capitalism voted, this bank shouldn't exit. Socialism as always stepped in and printed them some money and has been driving up inflation since. No idea why anyone still does business with them.

And as a parting gem BTW.... they are selling unregulated derivatives on the price of crypto... through an arm's length subsidiary/entity so some things never change, can't wait for the next ""oh they are too big to fail""... you would be doing more honest business with a Mexican cartel, to be quite frank.",115,u3jf9h,2022-04-14T16:04:32Z,2022-04-14

Advisory - Company has great market penetration, cultural relevance, dau, brand assets, contributor base. Under new leadership the price target could be closer to it's closest competitors such as fb.... based on a sum of it's parts breakdown.... Twtr could be as high as $150.

8193,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Is $TWTR worth buying right now?,"Musk obviously likes the twat platform but isn't entirely happy with the way it's run. He's referenced those things even before he bought his current stake, and yet a lot of apparent wokesters are reeeeeing because of --reasons- that are just twanging off the loose rubberbands between their own ears.

Some of those dipshites are at Goldman Sachs apparently, now advising that his price is somehow too low an offer in spite of being around 15 a share higher than their very own sell price rating.

I think he genuinely wants to buy it. And take it private. Hard to say how a shareholder vote would come out, but I think he gets it in the end. So it could be a profitable trade given the last price I bothered to check.

Disclaimer: I am not a twit. I do not have an account on the platform, and I have laughed at it since it's inception and have only grown to hate it. I also believe that in spite of the opportunities to make it better clearly being far greater than the possibility of making it worse, Elon is probably one of the few people who actually could succeed in making it better.",1,u3ino6,2022-04-14T16:06:14Z,2022-04-14

8195,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Is $TWTR worth buying right now?,"Been reading a lot of claims that this is another Elon pump and dump, which kinda makes me giggle.  If you are certain that it is, then buy puts.   If you think it will be approved buy calls or shares.  Personally I think it is risky either way so sitting on the sidelines as a spectator.

On that note, I do think he wants it.  It is a mature platform with over 300 million active users (actually reported over 330 million but assuming there are a lot of bots).  If I was a betting man, which obviously I am since I follow this board, if his offer is accepted he will, like he has hinted, go private where the new board will not have to be beholden to the stockholders.

My guess is that Twitter will then survive, and thrive through an annual fee.  Why is this my guess?  Well, he has stated it.  The ad revenue model forces the platform to limit speech that he feels is threatened.  Now I know many will find this ridiculous, but he does not.  He has stated many times that Twitter is the modern town square and all conversation should be allowed.

What would the annual fee do?  Well, glad you asked.  It will make certain that those that Tweet are real, or as real as technology can ascertain.  Everyone that pays for the blue check-mark would have to provide a phone and payment option (or some combination of that).  It wouldn't be flawless of course, I am certain bots will pay for their right to be heard also, but it would become expensive for whomever wanted their bot army to march forward.  

Lets assume that it costs you $10 a year to have your blue check-mark and no ads.   This is probably on the low end but it is easy math.  We could then easily compute that the private Twitter would be making approx. 3 billion per year.  Good place to put your money if you can do without it for 10-15 years.  Let the blue check-marks pay for your expensive technology platform purchase and tweet away with whatever you want to say.",1,u3ino6,2022-04-14T19:21:56Z,2022-04-14

The text read: ""As I indicated this weekend, I believe that the company should be private to go through the changes that need to be made. After the past several days of thinking this over, I have decided I want to acquire the company and take it private. I am going to send you an offer letter tonight, it will be public in the morning. Are you available to chat? 1.

    Best and Final: a. I am not playing the back-and-forth game.  b. I 
have moved straight to the end. c. It's a high price and your shareholders will love it. d. If the deal doesn't work, given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder. i. This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made.ii.

    And those changes won't happen 
without taking the company private. 2. My advisors and my team are available after you get the letter to answer any questions a. There will be more detail in our public filings. After you receive the letter and review the public filings, your team can call my family office with any questions.""

8256,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,Bearish on Musk buying TWTR? Here's what you can do.,"**TL;DR:** 

**Bearish on Musk Buying Twitter:** Buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40/share or less

**Bullish on Musk Buying Twitter:** Sell TWTR Puts for more than Strike Price - $54.20

&#x200B;

In case you haven't already heard, Elon Musk wants to buy twitter. ([SEC Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418091/000110465922045641/tm2212748d1_sc13da.htm))

The offer was stated to be best and final. Whether or not that's actually true is yet to be seen.   


Here are the obvious outcomes along with the probability based on yesterday's option open interest:

* Twitter accepts the offer. 
   * Shareholders are paid $54.20/share. 
   * Market Estimated Probability 65%
* Twitter rejects the offer, Musk stays a shareholder. 
   * Price has a small dip, but is otherwise flat.
   * Market Estimated Probability 15%
* Twitter rejects the offer, Musk dumps his shares.
   * Price falls back to pre-Musk levels.
   * Market Estimated Probability 20% 

Market is currently pricing in a \~20% chance of scenario 3 happening. I think that probability is higher, especially considering how volatile Musk can be. 

I recognize there may be new option buying to reflect the new probabilities. I can check that after \~5pm NY time and adjust my position on Monday. 

Implied volatility for the April through August strikes are very elevated, which reduce potential risk/reward on the play.

So, I'm looking to buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40/share or less as I think there's a better than 20% chance that Twitter rejects Musk's offer and Musk sells his shares.

For those who want to inverse me, you can sell Puts for any strike above $54.20, so that you can collect the premium, and the proceeds from the acquisition price of $54.20",57,u3g5u7,2022-04-14T12:15:12Z,2022-04-14

8459,twtr,stocks,POST,"Elon made a take-private offer to Twitter, he offered $54.20 per share, will TWTR continue to rise?","According to reports, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, CEO Elon has submitted a non-binding take-private proposal to Twitter on April 13, 2022, to be acquired for $54.20 per share in cash It does not yet own all of the issued common stock of Twitter.

The offer represents a 54% premium to Twitter's closing price on January 28, 2022 (the previous trade before Elon began a massive purchase of Twitter shares), and a premium of 54% to Twitter's closing price on April 1, 2022 (before Elon publicly bought the number of Twitter shares publicly available). a trade) at a 38% premium to the closing price.

Twitter said in its SEC filing that the proposal is not binding, and even if the two sides agree, the deal would depend on a number of other factors, including:

1) Receive any required government approvals;

2) Confirmatory legal, commercial, regulatory, accounting and tax due diligence;

3) Negotiation and implementation of the final agreement;

4) Complete the expected financing.

Twitter also stressed that there is no guarantee that a definitive agreement on the proposal will be signed, executed or completed. It was also uncertain if or when Twitter could respond to the proposal, nor a timetable for implementing any final agreement. At the same time, Elon has the right to withdraw the proposal or modify the terms at any time.

If the transaction eventually closes, Twitter's common stock will have its registration terminated under Section 12(G)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, Twitter said.

Recently, Twitter has been in the spotlight because Elon has become its largest shareholder.

According to a SEC filing last Monday, Elon owns 73,486,938 Twitter shares, or 9.2 percent, making him Twitter's largest shareholder. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal later said he would appoint Elon as a director of the company.

Elon responded by saying he would accept the position. ""I look forward to working with Agrawal and the Twitter board to make major improvements to Twitter in the coming months,"" Elon said!

Subsequently, Twitter employees and some industry insiders expressed concern that Elon would change Twitter's corporate culture. Earlier this week, Elon said he was no longer on Twitter's board

Analysts said at the time that this could pave the way for Elon to buy Twitter. Elon is barred from acquiring more than 14.5 percent of Twitter after joining the board, according to an agreement Elon reached with Twitter, a provision designed to limit his influence over Twitter.

But since Elon is no longer on Twitter's board, the 14.5 percent limit will also be lifted.",0,u3t7tm,2022-04-14T22:32:01Z,2022-04-14

First the company offered to buy, but it didn't go well. Then they did what Musk did and put out an offer to shareholders, but with paperwork.  They provided a contact number along with terms of the buyout. They required 50% plus 1 share for the deal to go through. I took the offer by tendering my shares by telling my broker as they all received the offer too. 
The companies intentions were to take it private and fire all management.  Believe me the management was pretty bad, but the patent they had was the prize. 

I am assuming Musk will do the same if he tries a hostile takeover,  but the issue is he would need 50% plus 1 to take it over. The company I invested in had huge dilution and debt as management sucked even though they had a very good patent. I'm not sure on Twitters shares as he would need to convince a big stock holder to sell to get control and I just don't see it happening.

8484,twtr,stocks,COMMENT,What happens to the TWTR shares people own if Twitter agreed to Musk's 100% offer?,"Former M&A banker here.

Quick answer: As this is a cash deal, you'll receive cash @ $54.20/share upon closing. It'll be credited to your brokerage account. 

In terms of mechanics -  right now, it's the Board that votes. Generally, majority wins. Interestingly, the timing is unique bc Twitter is about to have its board meeting for the year - assuming the shareholders are mostly 'for' the sale, if the BoD doesn't vote accordingly, their seats are vulnerable. But I think I heard the BoD nomination window has closed, but wanted to add this detail.

Elon already suspects the BoD will not be receptive, he is calling for it to be a shareholder vote - which is generally based on majority. The bylaws will have the specifics, have to search for the 'drag along rights' section. It will detail the minimum % of the votes to 'drag along' the rest of the shareholders into the deal.

An additional complication, based on Elon's latest Tweets of trying to maximize the highest % he can 'take private' with him (ie, you get shares in the private Twitter), is interesting. I'm sure the lawyers are working very hard to find out how this would be structured. Considering that for most private investments you have to be an accredited investor to participate, I think this will be tricky if you are not a millionaire",3,u3jsm1,2022-04-15T02:31:58Z,2022-04-15

Obviously Musk can vote for his own proposal, giving it a big boost, but since the offer is widely seen as too low, the board will likely reject it on behalf of shareholders.

Musk could then: (1) make a higher offer  (2) be petty and try to vote members off the board at the next shareholder meeting (3) be petty and sell his shares (4) who knows",6,u3jsm1,2022-04-14T17:30:02Z,2022-04-14

8513,twtr,stocks,COMMENT,What happens to the TWTR shares people own if Twitter agreed to Musk's 100% offer?,"Here is my understanding from my personal experience: board will vote to accept or reject. Reject means that musk can do hostile bid and his proposal goes directly to shareholders without board approval. Accept means proposal goes to shareholders with board blessing/recommendation. The proposal will likely need 90% approval at which point musk can force the last 10% to sell for 100% ownership. Musk could just aim for 50% ownership where he would have control over the company without owning all shares. This would allow him to change anything he wants without having to buy all shares. The shares not owned by musk could continue to trade publicly but musk would be sharing the profits in this scenario. This is somewhat similar to google where the founders have total control through special voting shares without owning the whole company.

Board can try to put in poison pill to prevent the hostile bid. This means implementing negative ramifications when one shareholder gets too large of a position. Getting board agreement to the proposal would avoid this.",1,u3jsm1,2022-04-15T02:41:57Z,2022-04-15

He could fuck shorts which I think maybe some have been after twitter. 

Technicals of twitter look great, after my class I‚Äôll post the technicals which are very bullish on all time frames. Not to pump it, no investment is GME. 

I swear I‚Äôve seen excel sheets showing insane numbers of FTDs and shares traded in dark pools of TWTR, probably retail buys rerouted in order to suppress some sort of retail financial support of twitter from having an impact on the price discovery of the share price. 

I only hold and DRS GME. 

Hear me out, Elon could amass the whole of twitter in a day and it would probably (knowing what we know about order rerouting due to PFOF) get shifted onto dark pools and barely picked impact the price Discovery of the stock.

Imagine Elon bought all of TWTR in the open market, and promptly proceeds to show the world on twitter that he DRS‚Äôd the whole company. showing the world this would cause huge price spikes and

Short squeezes, gamma squeezes financial market insanity would ensue, Elon could once again be the destroyer of ü©≥.

the already weak shorts because of GME, are faced to close that TWTR position and miss margin on GME? 

Big boys get fucked and maybe when it rains this time it gets hit with what‚Äôs been coming this whole time. 

Or even dumber would be if he DRS TWTR same day as Wu-tang album NFT wallet dividend gets announced.

RC YOU GON‚Äô GIVE US THAT WU-TANG ALBUM.

8543,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-20-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA (with p/l screenshots)"," Day three of essentially sideways range trading clocked in for the week. This is the most sideways I have seen the market day after day in a while. I think the market is a little on edge to say the least right now with earnings approaching and especially with the anticipation of Tesla earnings which are live now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9jcxe2qrru81.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e46d1b878ed7ac9e3693703a6864a7f42d71e9b

Tesla essentially killed it with earnings! I didn‚Äôt get to listen to the conference call but I hear they are thinking of a self driving vehicle subscription. Otherwise I didn‚Äôt hear any note worthy conference call news. 

&#x200B;

Being that its up 4.58% currently after market I don‚Äôt think there was anything scary either.

The key takeaways today for SPY were that 1. 447.2 is a MAJOR resistance that is going to take some time to get through and 2. 444 is a hella strong support that is also going to be tough to get through with 445 being noteworthy too. SPY continues to enjoy this sideways trading and to be honest I do too. I killed it today scalping these run ups and downs today. Ill take a day like this every single day.

Despite SPYs ability to do it today it FAILED to break the bear channel. This bear channel is utilizing the two most recent ‚Äúhighs‚Äù from March 29th and April 5th. That lower highs trend is still yet to be broken. Resistance will be at 447 tomorrow which is quite a peculiar resistance line with how strong that rejected us numerous times today. Support remains near 430 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/emlrltasrru81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb6ea2d7b5f62df28957b6771df45064cffd7a76

Despite the bears managing to close SPY red today at 0.07% the bulls made headway today. The bulls were able to break above the daily 100 ema at 446 today. However, they failed to close above it and settled for a close above the daily 8, 20, and 50ema which sit at 444. 27/ 444.38 and 443.31. Overall despite the sideways burning day SPY did have bullish momentum. Tomorrow if bulls can break this above 448 we will see the daily bear channel broken and I do believe riding off of Teslas great earnings we could see a rip to 460 next week or end of month. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/toot0xxsrru81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eee45e2b8e45595f63a57cc96355980d9f5268c

Apple enjoyed a sideways day too, however, struggled quite a bit more then SPY did today overall. We saw Apple reject the upward resistance line which is also its daily 20ema at 168.95 today. However, apple bulls are stacking candles on top of eachother now and I do suspect we will see this bear channel broke, especially with good news from the tesla earnings.  Apple closing above its daily 8ema is a bullish momentum move also. I fully expect apple to be able to have a green bull day near 170.5. 

&#x200B;

QQQ continues to stack candles higher also and appears to be establishing some bullish momentum. As I have mentioned before have suspect that the 338 level was the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù for now. I fully expect to see 370-375 end of month without any bad news catalysts. QQQ while breaking the daily 8ema and touching the daily 20ema failed to close above either today. QQQ bulls will need to take this opportunity to close above those key resistance lines tomorrow in order to see a bull week next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwti2x3urru81.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49d241a243c16e8ccac992159b88c3d31da33d4

The VIX enjoyed nothing but sideways trading all day today sticking to a tight $2.50 range almost all day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aonzikkurru81.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ebb40b0e7e49d05255c0134a8f2bb55cb44fc50

The VIX is now trading within its recent ‚Äúmean‚Äù with its recent range being 18.5 to 24.8. This lower vix is not only going to cause less volatility and smaller swings/ daily moves but its going to result in some more of these sideways boring days. With the VIX close to 18.5 then it has been since April 5th I will look for the bulls to take this as an opportunity to get this back to 450+. 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a hella good day on the server. I made/ called out 11 trades today and 10 of which were profitable (one did close at 0% but it was not red and I count that as a win). Here is my daily trade log

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 13%

4/20/2022 Call 2dte 24%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 10%

4/20/2022 Put 5dte -10%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 25%

4/20/2022 put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 18%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 8%

This is I believe one of if not the most trades I have made in a single day of trading yet and with a 90.9% win rate on the day. I did throw two 0dte in there today but sticking to no 0 dte and a smaller position size of 2500/ trade has made a massive difference this week. I also had some people I feel ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù of my actual trades and my log so today you will get a screenshot of my TOS. 

Today as you can see I actually played two Tesla ‚ÄúLottos‚Äù I had planned these to be overnight puts for earnings but I was able to close one at 50% and one at 18% which pretty much allowed me to play the current 4/22 855P I have open for free. Obviously unless sentiment changes over night those are going to take quite a massive hit at open but with a big enough IV pump ill be content with a 50% loss on it. But it is what it is and was a true one contract LOTTO paid for by my daily tesla put profits. 

Hyperwheel I was able to sell 3 puts and close at 50% profits for an additional $203.64 in premium today. I currently have 3 puts open sitting at 30% profit I suspect I will roll tomorrow. 

hyperwheel return is 4.04% 

buy and hold is 2.06%

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&#x200B;

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. 

&#x200B;

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn‚Äôt any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",21,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

8557,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-18-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA"," If someone was to ask me to ‚Äúdescribe a sideways day‚Äù I would show them todays chart. IT was the definition of sideways from open to start. One of the only days I can remember in a very a long time maybe ever when SPY made a HOD, LOD, retest HOD, retested LOD and then finishe din the dead middle of both of them‚Ä¶ Some sideways trading for sure.

You could have bought a 0dte put or 0dte call at open today and with enough patience been profitable very few days can you say that. So what did we learn from today? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xw5i37cidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=612e88c2919519334f328db0fa8242d569f3fb06

I referenced it on my pre-market analysis that we remain within the bear channel still with a now resistance of 440.7 to 441.7 and now support at 431.6 to 430.

Overall we started at the more support side of channel and have now finished more closer to the resistance side but overall we have no solid direction just from the intraday chart. I look for tomorrow to have a confirmed support or confirmed resistance test. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7103hvucidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bdabf47603dae71a8c3d3f26322c3b000d66b7

The intraday volume today was unbelievably low and was saved somewhat by the last 15minute candle but we still finished near 66mil total volume which is the 2nd lowest volume day since April 4th and March 24th. 

As you can see I am working on a theory we are going to bounce off support near 428 to 433 and from there work back to the 450 to 460 range. Arguably we looked poised end of day today to flush to 433 but we ended up reversing at the last minute there. 

We did remain in the bear channel with our next bear channel support at exactly 433.

Bears managed to close a FULL candle below the daily 200ema of 439.96 without even breaking it at all intraday which actually is a fairly bearish move overall and should see a lower push without any bullish sentiment overnight. Markets seemed to have rallied aggressively right at market close though. Being under the 200ema now we really don‚Äôt have another support that‚Äôs strong which is why I an using the January lows at the next logical support. 

Bulls will look to close back over 440 tomorrow and bears will look to get an even lower close near 433 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple too was a victim of sideways trading with a strong $3 range seeing a very similar movement of spy today, but a little less dramatic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9j28a2eidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c4ef3c8f3ecef360d10cc4e5ab5cf9068e4a0b

Apple did manage to close a red candle today (green on chart) but it‚Äôs a -0.13% day for Apple. 

Apple was early morning looking very strong ready to hold over its daily 100ema of 165.66 but quickly fell back below it and from there never broke it again. Todays candle for apple closed similarly to the candle from March 14th which is a hammer candle and COULD signal further upside for apple this week ahead. 

Bulls will need apple to close back above the daily 100ema to prevent any further retracements. 

Bears will look to capitalize on this down day with another red candle with a price target of the late January lows of 155 to 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j16myvleidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f88f39c078c10f31e2f062372ebaa0a919efea

QQQ today had a similar day as spy and apple clocking in a small 0.08% green day but seeing a major after market pop. 

Bears were able to make a new recent low for QQQ and will look to continue to capitalize on that this week. The candle closing inside the middle of the channel allows room for both directions easily tomorrow. However, it did finish a large bodies doji. Which after almost two weeks of red could signal a reversal tomorrow for green. 

I mentioned the January lows for apple and spy. QQQ is ahead of the game and today broke below the first low of 338.3 with its final low being 334.5. If we were to see QQQ close below 334.5 this week I would suspect we could see a further sell off down near 318 to 330 in the coming weeks. 

Bulls really need to get a nice green day tomorrow here to be able to break the daily 8ema. Until that resistance is broken QQQ is in some serious red trouble. 

&#x200B;

After a pretty significant gap up at open the VIX spent most of its day unwinding from its high of 24.6 to 21.98 end of day, another 12% range day for the VIX. Seems to be pretty common we have these huge VIX swings. It is slightly surprising with how massively the VIX unwound today that SPY did not have a green day. With the VIX down near its normal level and where it clung to end of last week we should see less volatility tomorrow and again the VIX should be a great guide for action to come. 

10% challenge-

Mondays historically is a day I struggle with profit wise and its probably cause lately Mondays have been anything but ‚Äútrendy.‚Äù Like we saw today, however, I was able to pull 1.5x daily profit goal so I cant be too upset about that at all. Lost a little on an end of day greedy put play but overall a great day despite the weird sideways day we had. 

4dte apple put= -26%

4dte spy call= 12%

4dte spy call= 12%

11dte apple call= -8%

4dte spy put= 20%

4dte spy put= -15%

2dte spy call 10%

Today I also officially began the hyperwheel utilizing the MES futures. I have three current open contracts. Two I sold together are sitting at +32% and one is sitting +12%. Looking to see if we continue the after hours green tonight to be able to roll my first profitable sold put or if we continue downside. I am excited for this venture of the hyper wheel. 

Overall this weekend after digging through the discords theta thread and compiling it all into one document (soon to be available just getting final touches!) I decided it was time to do it heads on. I am currently running 2:1 leverage and feel fairly comfortable with that leverage right now. As I continue day trading and with my monthly goal being $10k plus I was finding myself struggling with an ‚Äúend goal.‚Äù Yes of course goals to be ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù BUT what number? I didn‚Äôt have a number and I can only trade so many options and with this market im not comfortable upping my capital. I had plans to VTI and chill all profits but now that my capital has grown significantly I am at a good place to start the hyperwheel. I find the effort worth the reward in the end and I look forward to giving this venture a go. I will be adding my daily hyperwheel progress to my TA from now on for you to track and those who are curious to see it real world.",18,u6qx8f,2022-04-18T23:39:02Z,2022-04-18

[$SPY](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SPY&src=cashtag_click) : The white Line is a previous Resistance. If $SPY manages to bounces at the current price (Resistance from previous price action) then it will use the price of $437 as support & move up to $444 (resistance), if it can't defend the current price then seems destined to go down to $428. [\#StockMarket](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StockMarket?src=hashtag_click) [\#FederalReserve](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FederalReserve?src=hashtag_click) \#SPY it is going to be an interesting week.

8587,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,Timing a Recession? [$SPY - Predictions for the week of 4/18],"This is a prediction for the next 5 days except I will be talking about the timing of a recession further down.  

&#x200B;

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/rl9ahoicext81.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bedba763123e9d4535cfaf5275c00ba57bcbd60)

\~432 Support

\~452 Resistance

RSI is showing a strong oversold reading, this downtrend will most likely not continue in the near term.

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nbare8b2hxt81.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3cd58a26ceff9caadf6399d615a5aa5704c2b8)

The Bollinger bands are showing we are entering a period of lower volume and lower volatility.  I don't think we will see any major run up or down, in the next weeks (Unless there is major news).

&#x200B;

[10 Year Yield Correlation with Market Events](https://preview.redd.it/ovt5604mlxt81.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5bd6da40a63d7cb1c96b42ef9f53b24719af37)

So, back to timing a recession, this chart has gotten me very interested.  You don't need a Bloomberg terminal to do this analysis though, I realized there are many problems with using this as an indication.

&#x200B;

[30 Year Yields Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/x7ljsn94mxt81.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cbd12a0211926027298578d34e6cac326244d7)

Last week I said that the 30-year yields are better at predicting a market top.  Then I noticed, that both have margins of error, so finding the average of the 30Y + 10Y would be an even better indicator.  Also as the bond yields approach 0 they will decrease slower.  This is slightly an exponential trend, not a linear trend which can be fixed by graphing it logarithmically.

 

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/xb0ov8ljyxt81.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&s=d926fc6f86b3307182dd4f7c63aa3e3eba866aa6)

&#x200B;

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/zhuo5860zxt81.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7589143354bba01f71f05994a304f552c41a82)

As a continuation of the current uptrend in bond yields, I would expect the yields to cross this major level around the middle of June.  

&#x200B;

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/lsbab1e71yt81.png?width=1478&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a6fbe97a05d8422c9d5c27ebfe8f80e6c858647)

This has predicted the top within about 5 months, exception of '94 though. 

&#x200B;

[Comparisons](https://preview.redd.it/0zqtd3144yt81.png?width=1475&format=png&auto=webp&s=dff90c779a6a9520481562fc83cd2f8f19f2ea68)

From this, I can conclude that when we have some recession in the next year, the central bank is just going to print more money and devalue our currency.  This is not a crisis though, no need to keep gold bars under your bed.  Maybe in another 30 years, it will be time to buy gold bars.  I just hope JPOW does not get too crazy and go to negative rates.

&#x200B;

[Federal Reserve Calendar](https://preview.redd.it/6479csug5yt81.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=1832a0db4029b7dbc20b208589f0e8df25488da7)

**Predictions**

I am not expecting any major moves in the market this week.  The stock market will most likely be fine until June.  I will look back at this in May though.  

Jerome Powell will talk Thursday at 1 pm, he may talk about reducing the balance sheet.  I don't think he will say anything crazy though, they are trying to keep the economy as stable as they can.  

Next Week I am just expecting a general uptrend in the overall market.  I will be looking for opportunities not just opening trades to have open positions.  It's very important to find asymmetric trades not FOMOing into OTM options. 

There is nothing crazy this week...

 \* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more 

**Forecast**

(Remember the 5-day outlook is the least serious part of my analysis, it is extremely hard to predict which days will be red or green)

8594,spy,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Timing a Recession? [$SPY - Predictions for the week of 4/18],"We need to remember that the thesis for bond yield analysis as a recession predictor is based on two things:

 \- The idea that bond yield differences and changes reflect investor sentiment.

 \- The fact that banks draw in capital from bond yield spread.

Both of these require normal market conditions and constrained cash reserves... but right now the Fed is actively manipulating the bond market and will be for the foreseeable future in a way that doesn't correlate to any other time in history, and banks are absolutely swimming in cash reserves right now.

As a result, the normal assumptions for their relationship to larger macroeconomic recessions are broken. Now I'm not saying that we will/won't have one... I can't see the future... just saying that bond considerations need to be balanced with this in mind and against other macroeconomic factors, many of which point away from there being a recession at the moment.",5,u57ukd,2022-04-17T05:13:02Z,2022-04-17

8617,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",69,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

\* Following the 80 point rally from the lows yesterday we noted that that the remaining strength despite a high PPI print as mentioned yesterday would likely be as a result of charm flows going into the market from MOPex. Using historical data on Opex without understanding the context of positioning automatically provides limited info on actual movements that are to be expected. 

\* Based on macro conditions we do not expect natural buyers to exist and with negative seasonality appearing we do not expect bounces to be maintained.

\* VIX levels based volatility range of +1.3%/-1.3%, Negative gamma environment volatility is likely to continue to be more volatile than the prior week given the switch up in positioning. 

\* SPY remains in less negative territory across the board (both short and long term) (now at $-1.2Bn, down from -$1.8bn yesterday looking two months forward). This has normalised the current levels for this this year, we can expect volatility to maintain and should also expect ranges on either side of the equation but a natural trend higher remains as the final parts of inventory are cleared. See gamma results in the discord to view peak positioning. We continue to maintain that the natural trend still remains lower and based on analogues May seems to be a reasonable point at which we reach a bottom. (There remains a LOT of cash on the side lines that is yet to be deployed). 

\* Call volumes +12.8% and put volumes +4.97% with puts now only \~2x the volume of calls, following a peak call/put volume disparities. This tells us that the hedge is now coming full circle and as a result given the 

\* 10 Delta Put premiums (455C) vs call IV (at the 10 delta, 435P) is 1.5x in the short term and 1.6 xacross duration an IV basis, the skew here suggests that on the short term basis puts aren‚Äôt favourable. They do however remain more favourable beyond this week. Additionally this vol isn‚Äôt the highest read we have had thus far, with 2x presenting very strong risk reward. IV skew blows out below 425 and with the tails now currently offering an asymmetric return for those involved in the options market. Flows pushing lower should likely slow.

For order flow perspective levels please see the levels provided in the chart. See these lines as ‚Äúbarriers‚Äù to overcome and if done then price can be ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù into areas where previous buyers (Navajo white = up volume) and sellers (purple = down volume) wanted to engage up until points where there are much greater levels of volume. These are areas that you can consider as greater points of resistance.

Calls/Puts Volume

üêÇ Scenario 

Above 4444 (with continuous bid at 4460) ($ES) additional call buying to increase up the chain at further expiries and up the chain would be needed to continue this drive up. Note the skew toward call buying has lightened again but below we have a large delta of puts are set to unwind today which can give room to a bounce. We need put buying in further duration to lower and call buyers to move higher. Continuous exhaustion @ 4444 (we are at 4419 as of writing - having found repeat support at 4454) in the first 30 mins defines whether there is a clear aggressive direction and a move above could set us up for a hold above 4580 should positioning continue to drive higher. VIX crush below 18 will also help produce the environment we expect.

üêª Scenario

If we maintain below 4400 in particular we‚Äôre interested in further sell off as this level provides a key level down. That being said this remains a strong floor and looks unlikely to break where we assign a 17% probability of this breaking. A break below this could generate sell down to 4300 as Vanna flows above drive us lower and with put gamma at 4350 and below increasing exponentially. This begins to act as a magnet to price with selling intensifying from above and below. We would need to see call buying decline in AAPL/TSLA as well as semi weakness, very important as TSM has just reported upward guidance. VIX maintaining over 22, new highs with VIX combined with ES new lows 22 which adds credibility to increased sell. We would also need to see some weakness in big tech, in particular we note AAPL, TSLA, MSFT as these remain the key drivers of the prior rally particularly and strength in gold miners and other precious metal cos (NEM, GLD,SLV etc)",14,u3h65i,2022-04-14T13:08:31Z,2022-04-14

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps‚Ä¶ 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it‚Äôs the roaring 20s again‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours‚Ä¶ its still a break and that‚Äôs a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken‚Ä¶ lets see if we can find a new trend or not‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked‚Ä¶

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green √† red. Red. Red. √† green -> red. Red √† green √† red red red √† green √† red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)‚Ä¶ we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p‚Ä¶ There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k‚Ä¶. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k‚Ä¶ even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t3s9ml37ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=caae03fb35e40ce7d87b6e44177c9523ad875915

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ec85a98ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6536fb69f982d3b1953e249887f471e25f9509e

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis‚Ä¶ a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again‚Ä¶ definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gyfddp8ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38157a204b956632b698a1e2b2cf5100e80d564

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uv62879ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d8dcb465098b551f8c4f7fb36d1f9d3bfd5bbc

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lp9tapp9ydt81.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=76b08aaafc4107a52badba56b1940331f26be44c

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don‚Äôt like to hold positions over night‚Ä¶ 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there‚Ä¶ but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don‚Äôt believe in what you are trading and you don‚Äôt believe in the move that‚Äôs about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",45,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.  It's one big conspiracy that will one day be excused as a preventative measure to prevent foreign countries from disrupting our markets after the 9/11 tragedy (or something else that pulls on our heartstrings).

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Edit:  We will see real market value once Darkpools are closed and all trades are on the exchange.  Until then, this private practice needs to be revolutioned.

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn‚Äôt ‚Äúmanipulation‚Äù it‚Äôs just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

These are some of the biggest companies tracking the S&P, which is.... made up of the biggest companies.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index.

8712,spy,Superstonk,COMMENT,SPY Crash Comparison: Have We Already Seen the Top?,"The crash was supposed to happen last February 18 2021 but they have been fake pumping the economy....hyper inflation is the cure per JPOW...

Once hyper inflation wipes out the dollar its game over for everyone and you will be forced to use Fed Coin....

Something something  2026/2029 

RC and Matt Finestone along with Byron and Wang all knew this when they were brain storming on how to provide a new system for retail while the old one crashes and burns...

8714,spy,Superstonk,COMMENT,SPY Crash Comparison: Have We Already Seen the Top?,"I was tired of waiting for the SPY guy to post. **IF** we're seeing a repeat of 2008's crash pattern (algorithm stuff blah blah blah), I wonder if we've already reached the top.

Movements obviously aren't perfectly replicated, but a correlation *does* seem to be there if you look at the chart comparison I put together. Could external forces (all the crazy shit happening in the world right now) be throwing the algorithm off? I'm too smooth to have the answers or even to ask the right questions sometimes so please, add your opinions or tell me how wrong I am. To me, it looks like SPY may not get that extra push up to a new ATH that I was expecting.

Edit: By the way, I tried to make the 2 charts reflect the same amount of time. Each candle is 1 day, each chart shows a little over 1.5 years.",17,u5uzwz,2022-04-17T20:11:36Z,2022-04-17

Saving y'all a click:

One night earlier this year, AIG Global Investment Corp. hedge fund investment executive Norman Chait found himself sitting between Citadel's risk arbitrage head, Alec Litowitz, and a trader from another major hedge fund at a dinner sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ""When the other trader was turned away, Alec talked to me about business,"" says Chait. ""When the trader would turn in our direction, Alec would immediately start talking about kids' videos. This went on all night.""

When pressed, Citadel's partners were no more revealing with this magazine. But interviews with traders and a review of the firm's offering memorandums and investor letters does provide a glimpse behind the curtain.

The firm applies 15 strategies, but about 85 percent of its profits in the past few years have come from convertible bond trading, risk arbitrage and other event-driven strategies, say investors. Convertible bond trading and similar equity derivatives trading account for more than half the firm's profits.

Global in reach, Citadel, which uses leverage aggressively on certain positions, has built up big holdings in Japan; at times these have amounted to more than 70 percent of the firm's convertible positions.

Up 12.6 percent through the end of July, Citadel has outperformed many rivals because it steered clear of the hard-hit telecommunications sector. In risk arbitrage and event-driven trading, one of the firm's coups this year was making money on the failed General Electric Co.-Honeywell International deal, which caused considerable losses for many risk arb units.

The firm has occasionally stumbled. In the late 1990s Citadel amassed big positions in the equity-linked derivatives issued by money-center Japanese banks, hoping to take advantage of mispricings created by the unusual complexity and giant size of the offerings. But the trades soured. The firm scrambled out after suffering a loss of 2 percent in one month, but the same securities became a big moneymaker for Citadel in the next two years. ""We respect them a lot,"" says Louis Salkind, managing director of archrival hedge fund group D.E. Shaw & Co. ""They are certainly one of the top players in the world of arbitrage. We cross paths with them all the time. They are huge.""

Citadel has become increasingly aggressive in private placements, including the exotic field of Pipes, private investments in public entities. Over the past six years, it invested in 80 private transactions worth $550 million in public companies, according to DirectPlacement, a San Diego investment bank specializing in the area. Many of the Citadel deals, in companies such as MicroStrategy and eToys, had a reset provision allowing the company to convert at a lower price if the stock fell.

One variety of these convertible securities, known as ""death spirals,"" has no floor on the conversion price and has become increasingly controversial. These securities get their name from the combination of the investor's right to short the stock and the right to reset the conversion price, which creates a potential incentive for holders of the securities to push down the price of the stock. In January 2001 Providence, Rhode Island, telecommunications company Log On America sued Credit Suisse First Boston and two funds controlled by Citadel, charging that they had caused the firm's stock price to collapse, from $17 to less than $1, by engaging in short-selling after buying death-spiral converts.

""We are alleging that they bought the security with the intent of manipulating the stock,"" says David Paolo, CEO of Log On America. Paolo says Citadel engaged in ""massive"" short-selling, but Citadel, which declines to comment, bought only $3.75 million worth of the convertibles. Citadel is also enmeshed in a small investment in a company whose recent history seems like a bad movie. Soon after Citadel loaned $25 million to a Florida casino cruise company called SunCruz Casinos, a previous owner was murdered while driving down a Fort Lauderdale street by someone firing a gun from a black Mustang. The Miami Herald then printed allegations that one of the new owners, ex-Dial-A-Mattress franchisee Adam Kidan, had made ""food and beverage consulting"" payments to a caterer with alleged mob connections. Fort Lauderdale homicide detective John King says the murder remains unsolved and Kidan is not a suspect. The Citadel loan is still performing, but the profitable SunCruz filed for Chapter 11 to deal with a blizzard of lawsuits. Kidan, who has since left the company, has said the payments were legitimate business expenses. He did not return a message left with his attorney.

Citadel won't say how it fared on private placement investments in other fallen companies such as eToys. But, says DirectPlacement president Brian Overstreet, ""I think they made a lot of money from these other transactions because they were around long enough for them to trade out. But it's impossible for anyone to really know how they did.""

That's just how Citadel likes it. - H.L.",77,u3qm9z,2022-04-14T21:24:07Z,2022-04-14

And that folks, is how you get a ""consulting firm"" to do your dirty deeds--but they are not done dirt cheap.

You know what is even sicker? Hiring a shitty cancerous vampire consulting firm like BCG to do your crime for you, but making the company that is the target of your hit pay the ""consulting fee.""

1. Start naked shorting and ""providing liquidity"" in a stock (internalizing buy orders and ""filling"" them with synthetic shares so there is no upward pressure on price)
2. Have a plant investor buy enough shares to influence the board, and put in a shitty mole CEO and/or CFO, who then begins making shit business decisions (like hiring BCG) and taking on debt backed by company assets.
3. Have BCG suggest one of your ""risk arbitrage"" hedge/corp bonds packages (don't call it a ""death spiral"" tho. *Death Spira*l FFS. Honestly, these guys cannot help twirling their fucking moustaches, can they?) which will allow the company to convert when share price gets too low, incentivising insider shorting and putting more leverage in Citadel's hands.
4. After years of shitty business decisions at the cynical advice of BCG, and all the debt on the balance sheets making the stock look undesirable, the business declines and the stock gets cellar boxed. When it goes to 0 Citadel hits the bankruptcy jackpot, pays BCG their bonus, Amazon or whatever competitor is involved scoops up cheap assets and market share.
5. The moral arc of the universe takes another dump thanks to evil parasites.

I wonder how many examples you have to come up with before it becomes pattern evidence? Nevermind, BCG probably has a judge-bribing service as well.

9022,fb,wallstreetbets,POST,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"Not just for the year, but the upcoming earnings as well.  

Two reasons why:

1) If you were a customer using FB platform to market advertising and you saw what you did in FB's previous earnings, would you continue spending the same amount on advertising when you could spend that on platforms showing new, massive volumes of growth?  **In other words, is the opportunity cost blatantly obvious?** Or do you just stick it out with Facebook assuming that there will be 1) changes to it's other platforms to help bring in new people in/retain them or 2) the metaverse will be the latest and greatest.  Both seem almost like common sense.  The answer is no, neither will happen or be a thing. I'd imagine that their support going into the previous earnings has substantially lowered because of this.  Thus, much less revenue compared to what it previously dropped too.

2) The metaverse will be a epic failure on a level never seen before. It really does show to the world that Zuck doesn't have what it takes to understand what demand is (since he stole the FB idea). I mean really ask yourself this: **Are you going to wear a headset to check social media on your lunch break at work?**  When you wake up? When you're taking a shit.  *At best, for many interested, it's going to be in the evening or maybe over the weekend.*  This means *significant less* coverage time for advertisement compared to the previous model.  Thus, in order to sustain growth and returns for investors (more like prevent people from selling), they announced that each transaction will give FB half of it's value which again, does the complete opposite for maintaining growth.  Especially when other platforms offer a much more realistic model that enables coverage for low charge or completely free.

You tell me, does wearing an oculus headset sound like something you would wear during various periods of the day? How about buying NFTs or digital currency through the platform? What can this model offer that is tangible and worth the value of giving FB half of the cost involved?

Or better yet, would it seem strange to wear an oculus headset while getting coffee near you? How about if you saw someone else doing it? Do you think they can order coffee or stand in line doing this without looking like a weirdo? We've all seen how fucking strange it is to see people doing instagram feeds to show-off a life style they don't have. How about in line at the grocery store? Does that seem fitting and not awkward to do? Because I can tell you right now, ***nobody will do that.*** Not unless they design a model that makes it so that you don't stick out like a weirdo and also function around you.",55,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:19:51Z,2022-04-18

9027,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"I've been working with the Occulus since the Kickstarter, and interactivity devices such as hand motion interfaces for ages now, and the thing that gets forgotten is how good the mouse is as a device that augments your motion with minimal movements compared to do arm circles for half an hour in the air. By the same token, the phone is so successful because of its ability to give a (false) sense of being in control by being able to put it in your pocket, and interface by voice or a few fingers taps and limited body movement, and as you've even described a low onramp to usage.

I took a Halolens 2 over to a family get together a few months back. Everyone, even the gamer kids, used it for about 10 min apiece, and it sat there on the counter the rest of the day. Govenrment VR labs mostly sit around begging for work and trying to concoct reasons for people in the military or government to give a shit which tend to fall on deaf ears.

I was so excited for the prospects I kickstarted Occulus and took the DK2 with me around to try with a lot of people, so I get the nerdy interest, but the aforementioned issues result in my halolens, oculus, and other sets mostly just collect dust even from me. I am deeply familiar with a project attempting to bring things to contact lenses, but that is still a ways off. Perhaps metaverse one day, but I don't think anyone trusts one run by Zuck, and I don't think the tech is there to bring it mainstream anytime soon.",21,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:33:43Z,2022-04-18

9039,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"The metaverse isn't for you. It will catch on with kids. They'll buy roblux with their parent's cards and decorate their little minecraft houses with their fortnite skins or whatever. Then, when those 10 year olds turn 25 and keep using it, it will eventually start to take off with ""boomers"" (anyone currently over the age of 15).

That's how facebook happened, anyway. All this shit looks like ass until lameass kids start using it and make it popular, at which time you will be old and still complaining that it's just a fad.

There's a reason their tech demo looked like a pixar movie. They're gonna convince parents that they need to buy their kid a VR thing for christmas, the kids will use it to do lame kid shit (think myspace 2005), and eventually it'll just be a thing.

Doesn't change your thesis, since I doubt Facebook will be the one to capitalize. But the metaverse is going to be a thing, because they obviously want to make it a thing (because monetization), and boomers like me and you hating on it just makes it more appealing to the kids.",-3,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:43:49Z,2022-04-18
9040,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"People are just spooked by the dip in user growth, if that shows an uptick at all, there's no way they drop below where they are right now. Unless they post absolutely massive losses related to VR. A young tech company trading at a 15 P/E is not normal at all. Their previous earnings showed they still have the biggest platform by a long shot, I don't see why anyone would just stop using them for that reason.

I also don't think you are giving the VR/AR business an accurate representation. I don't think all of these ideas are directly connected. Pretty sure the NFTs/marketplace idea is going to be implemented in their normal phone apps.

The VR business has more to offer as a revenue stream than just advertising so I think it's pointless to even entertain that as being why it will fail.

I'm not big on the VR idea myself, but I still think FB will continue to dominate large areas of the internet. If they keep getting negative feedback related to VR, they're going to scrap it. I don't think they die on that hill.",1,u6l454,2022-04-19T06:13:44Z,2022-04-19

Another 10% who know FB has helped them in the past, and are continuing to try while exploring other options. The rest are leaving in droves.

9053,fb,wallstreetbets,POST,Why has FB tanked so hard?,"This might not be the place to appeal to the fundamentals of a stock but I'm left scratching my head looking at this company's financial statements and the price action. 

FB has great margins, great revenue growth for their size, more cash and short term investments on their balance sheet than ALL (not just current) liabilities, great operational performance, and are pushing into what is being labelled as a ""new trillion dollar industry"" in the metaverse.

I know that Apple's new privacy rules are cause for concern and that the metaverse is not a sure thing. But I'd be willing to bet that they can figure out some way to either get around the privacy concerns or spy on their users some other way lol. As far as the metaverse is concerned I don't feel inclined to bet against Mark Zuckerberg, he is one of the most successful people at his age in human history (someone else made a post here about that, pretty well thought out.) Even if the venture doesn't produce any cash flow in the next few years, do you think they'd just keep pouring money into it or do you think they would just discontinue it? 

I've also heard the monthly average user argument, which I find so dumb. When they have somewhere in the ball park of 3.5 BILLION people (or registered users) who use one of their apps I would expect them to see some tapering in growth considering a world population of 7.9 billion. Even if there was some decline in MAU they are still the best in the industry at extracting revenue from each user, and that growth rate has been very steadily increasing since it went public. 

Before anyone mentions Tik Tok, I am aware they are eating FB's lunch, they're the most concerning factor right now in my mind.",0,u3x3xs,2022-04-15T01:51:32Z,2022-04-15

Not sure that's a product anyone really wants.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.

9213,amc,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,GME and AMC,"Both are dinosaurs and novelties of a past era. Their cultural relevance was little to none before the 'short squeeze' of 2021 happened.

If you'll remember, GME's market cap went *lower* than its book value, which is its real assets such as real estate, inventory, etc. That's weird, but not uncommon when companies are tumbling down. It's an indication that people who were trying to make a buck off its downfall, got greedy and pushed the price way below what the market considered fair.

That's ultimately how we're in the situation today. Of course, GME brought in new leadership and are rapidly trying to adapt its business. Hard to gauge their potential given the competitors in all the spaces GME is trying to grow, but anyway.",8,u7y65j,2022-04-20T15:09:49Z,2022-04-20

Disney murdered the Star Wars franchise with their woke nonsense. Netflix can't develop anything interesting because they've knelt to the woke agenda.

The woke agenda destroys creativity and humor, it kills storytelling and makes thing less relatable not more.  The entire entertainment industry will continue to collapse because of this.  Will Smith slapping a comedian for telling a joke is a clear sign of just how bad it's getting.  Jesters have always functioned as a check on the powerful, and the powerful are now checking them.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Do you think this is logical?

Factoring in also the significant increase in competition; this has caused dilution of market share for anyone in the space. So despite the problems pertaining to only NFLX people are probably going to reduce their exposure to streaming services as whole.

To name a couple of things.

The future of TV is changing and no one knows who will be the most successful, but I believe at least a few of these companies will bundle multiple platforms, and Disney is well on their way.

Also adding ESPN+ has grown tremendously, with rights to the NHL and NBA playoffs about to start, baseball, soccer both domestically and internationally, exclusive rights to a majority of college football games, I believe they are headed in the right direction.",2,u7kpao,2022-04-20T11:46:08Z,2022-04-20

Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week.

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. 

&#x200B;

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",73,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

Like sell 85 call and buy ATM call during market opening. That way iv wouldn't hugely affect caption value. But you are the one that risked their money after all.

9513,nvda,stocks,POST,Thoughts on putting 5k into market 90% vti/schd & rest in Roku and NVDA?,"Hi I suck at stocks and investing. I started during the initial gme bubble and moves into boring stocks and I'm still down 6% 90% of my portfolio is vgt and vti with more vti than vgt. Rest is soxx, tiny bit in Netflix (woo..) and NVDA. Funny enough NVDA I've jumped in and out since early last year and somehow only stock I've done decent on.

Anyway I'm 30 and have only a couple gs in the market but want to continue to try to create some money as job wages are flat/going down with inflation and me ever making good money is unlikely. I save all my money and that seems to be hurting me.

Thinking of putting another $5000 into mostly save stuff vti and schd to have a safe investment and some slow building dividends. I noticed Roku is dipped a lot which surprises me as they seem to be a healthy company and actually look to have an upside with being on everything, investment in a Roku channel to get more direct as rev from tv and shows and are even looking to make original shows. They are ad supported but with inflation and people trying to save money I can see people using them more instead of premium streaming services. Thoughts on putting $200 in them? And then there is NVDA, seems like it will continue going up bad idea, also seems healthy. We always need processors.",2,u82lcp,2022-04-20T18:06:15Z,2022-04-20

Roku has generally sold devices at a loss or break-even to get more people on the service - the real core business is advertising. With supply chain issues, costs more and more to make a device.

IMO, you're going to see consolidation in services. Roku won the day not that long ago because it was the ""neutral party"" that had all the apps and that's all they had to do. Now you're looking at what seems an awful lot like oversaturation of streaming apps and will probably be more and more deals like WB/Discovery and with larger customers there may be more fights a la Roku vs Google last year.

Roku going more and more into original programming - now you're getting into something else entirely. The thesis not that long ago was fairly simple/straightforward. 

More and more people going out.

I like ROKU better than NFLX and ROKU is so obliterated at this point that a bounce wouldn't be surprising, but it's not the same thesis as when I owned it in 2019/2020 and therefore not really interested in it as a long-term holding anymore.",2,u82lcp,2022-04-20T18:42:12Z,2022-04-20

Roku and Nvidia are both trendy tech stocks so I'd stay away. Nvidia is already a top 10 or to 20 holding in VTI, so you don't need to buy more.

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing).

Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index.

9593,amd,wallstreetbets,POST,Long $AMD - My Next Potential 10X AMD Trade,"Hi fellow apes,

Long time no see.

Some of you may remember me from my two insane $AMD trades last year, both of which [went up 1000%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzngtn/85k_to_850k_10x_in_2_months_im_not_selling/).I have one of those for you today.

This is a multi-pronged thesis for why I went long on $AMD at these levels, which I will summarize in the following points :

\-- Macro Picture --

The market has just experienced a major correction which lasted several months and was fueled by the fed tightening monetary policy. I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten used to a more hawkish fed.

The fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters. Primarily because  :

1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.

2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war has mostly already been baked in since March.

Slowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.

\-- AMD's Fundamental Picture --

AMD's price has been cut by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \~$160. Nothing fundamental about AMD's business has changed. The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.

In my opinion demand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year. AMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens its competitive position in the server business, an area where the it's been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in history for AMD.

The company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 ""Zen 4"" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which will extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and expand margins.

\-- AMD's Technical Picture --

In my opinion there's a strong likelihood that AMD has bottomed here at the \~$90 level. Here's why :

\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.

\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.

\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trend since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive ""gray"" buy zone in my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years. Following those 3 instances AMD went up by 38%, 240% & 66% respectively.

This DD encompasses my opinions and educated guesses about the macroeconomic and monetary environments for this year which may or may not be accurate. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. Manage your risk.

Other random shit I'm looking at:

Interesting option data from yesterday, looks like $18.6M in 01/23 155p were sold. Someone closing out a huge put position, will try to track down when these were purchased to confirm.

I'm also looking at the $90-$92 level for a bounce. 50% retracement from the low in May2021 and substantial support going back to Sep2020. 

A few analysts downgrading AMD has pushed price down to like a 160 day low? OK. Right.

Lisa Su estimated that the chip shortage will be less severe in 2nd half of 2022, this was back in Sep2021.

TSM had positive earnings this week. I wonder who they manufacture chips for? Hmmmm.

AMD was well ahead of supply chain issues at the very start of COVID, they plan for demand years in advance. 

They've also released data on a new ""gaming"" chip last week that is almost 1/2 the cost of the Intel equivalent (sort of).",31,u446bu,2022-04-15T10:55:01Z,2022-04-15

9648,amd,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvg7y9w7flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=80c743f2529336a5252a6e5ec363ef449d3f2805

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8h8w8sk8flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad9975294ee40cd03342febaf5cb1275945383f

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. 

&#x200B;

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",69,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

Like sell 85 call and buy ATM call during market opening. That way iv wouldn't hugely affect caption value. But you are the one that risked their money after all.

A few questions for you if you don't mind:

1. How much capital do you typically use in your options trading?
2. Are they naked options trades?
3. What are the different colored lines? I think they are EMA but I can't tell for certain at the moment
4. How are you identifying the red and grey ""channels""?
5. What software are you running?

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps‚Ä¶ 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it‚Äôs the roaring 20s again‚Ä¶ 

&#x200B;

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours‚Ä¶ its still a break and that‚Äôs a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken‚Ä¶ lets see if we can find a new trend or not‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked‚Ä¶

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green √† red. Red. Red. √† green -> red. Red √† green √† red red red √† green √† red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)‚Ä¶ we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p‚Ä¶ There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k‚Ä¶. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k‚Ä¶ even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. 

&#x200B;

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break.

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57.

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis‚Ä¶ a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again‚Ä¶ definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week.

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don‚Äôt like to hold positions over night‚Ä¶ 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there‚Ä¶ but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don‚Äôt believe in what you are trading and you don‚Äôt believe in the move that‚Äôs about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",44,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

9702,amd,stocks,COMMENT,AMDs latest acquisitions,"I can't say I understand Xilinx much more than what AMD is letting on - i.e. gives access to the 5G and vehicle markets, as well as Xilinx having strong AI inference capability over Nvidia. Also best practices for AI will change over time, so Xilinx's programmability may allow units to adapt to new practices without designing new chips, also allows for prototyping faster during these changes.

In terms of Pensando, my understanding is that it allows AMD to flesh out their network offerings to compete with Nvidia's Bluefield and Intel's IPU. How important is the tech that allows Pensando to offer something that is 5-10x better than AWS Nitro, I don't know or understand.

What I do feel strongly about is that AMD has now recruited people that are the top of their fields in terms of leadership, innovation and expertise - Victor Peng from Xilinx, MPLS team from Cisco. I don't really know who David Wong is (not that I know any of them personally, haha), but I guess we'll see how RDNA3 turns out.

The people who run and direct the organizations are really important. You can have talented and smart engineers but if they aren't motivated or allowed to blossom, then the whole company will go down the drain. It's pretty important to understand that it's the employees that do the engineering, but the direction and guidance and direction set by strong and experienced leadership is equally important.

9707,amd,stocks,COMMENT,AMDs latest acquisitions,"I‚Äôm guessing is a way to compete with nvidia who is also making some moves beyond gpu.

As google and Apple  dwells more into making its own cpus and maybe Microsoft and their artificial intelligence it‚Äôs something these cpu makers might be trying to think ahead so they don‚Äôt end up in a Facebook type scenario where their eggs relied too much in apples or any one companies ecosystems. Right now they rely a lot on Microsoft for gaming, servers Os, and Xbox. Microsoft decides to go the Apple way and could be bad for amd and nvidia. 

And amd seems to be preparing to work more in its own SOC. 
But on her one words it‚Äôs about adaptive computing capabilities. 
Which seems to be about making one fast chip to power everything instead of having different  components like cpu here and gpu there etc. 
And it adapts to what‚Äôs needed. 

So if it‚Äôs for a gamer then inside it‚Äôll use more power for graphics but if it‚Äôs server then not.
Apples silicon still has different components inside even though it‚Äôs one chip. I think amd is aiming at a way to have all components working the same but it‚Äôs a different tech where there woudnt be any difference between cpu or gpu .

Not sure of course, but if it‚Äôs true then her statement of being able to capture some of that cloud server market as programs and even operating systems are migrating to the cloud. Therefore a gamer might need more graphic power than a normal server so those potential new amd chips would do everything at once.
Or something along those lines. 

AMD is also looking for data centers and even virtual reality. Which in some futuristic sci-fi scenario you‚Äôd have the meta verse being streamed into your VR headset and a lot of grunt  work would be coming from the cloud servers.
Therefore the same chip powering both the computer in the cloud and the VR headset would make sense instead of custom chip for everything. 

So basically preparing to stream games from the cloud into peoples VR headset in the meta verse. And make sure companies use amd servers instead of AWS. 
I think that‚Äôs the main plot. Grab some of that Amazon server market to later not rely on any one platform or company for whatever tech comes next.",4,u5sbq0,2022-04-17T22:40:06Z,2022-04-17

9741,amzn,wallstreetbets,POST,DD - $AMZN 2500 PUTS 4/29,"Amazon will tank on earnings due to 7 factors:

1. Price increase announced in February 16
2. Amazon stock buyback/split announced March 9, 2022
3. Amazon 5% fuel/inflation surcharge announced April 13
4. $JBHT last mile logistics company Q1 results
5. Valuation/growth issues
6. Competition hitting inflection point
7. $UPS earnings 4/26 TBD



1 - Amazon announced a price increase which reflects that internally they are seeing increases costs and likely new member stagnation. Market has likely reached saturation like $NFLX reached.

2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp. We know stock split means nothing in reality but it's used to pump up the market on your company.

3 - This is weird that it came out about a month and change after quarter end. Seems like management/board received draft financials and didn't like what they saw. A 5% surcharge is their ""fix"" for future quarters.

4 - $JBHT just had earnings with 33% revenue growth and huge earnings growth. Except ALL of that earnings growth is because they charge a fuel surcharge. Without it they had lower earnings than 2021.

5 - The valuation for a company growing operating cash flow 10-15% would be in the 20x -25x normally. This company hides the fact that they can't create real cash flow using stock based comp and they are granting so much that they now can't buy enough back to even stay at 0 dilution. We may see Amazon only grow high single digits (inflation rate) and the premium does not make sense. Same issue as Netflix.

6 - $TGT, $WMT, $COST and other retailers are doing a much better job of leveraging their local stores with delivery. They can share the delivery price burden with their retail store sales and absorb more costs. TGT is growing at the same revenue year over year as $AMZN as of FY 20 to FY 21.

7 - Watch $UPS earnings to get an idea of how the costs of delivery were in Q1. This will give us more insight into what to expect for $AMZN.

I am risk averse so putting like 1% of my boomer portfolio into $2500 Puts. If I am right I expect a COVID roundtrip back to $2100 by the end of the month. I expect $2400 to be the realistic initial sell-off. At $2400 you make $250-$300 into $10k so risk/reward is there. I will have a few thousand worth. Have $1k so far but will add as we get closer and likely after $UPS earnings.

Biggest risk is that I DO think AWS will continue to do well AND I think capex for AWS may be cheaper than expected (Check GPU/CPU prices dropping everywhere and becoming readily available).

For chart fiends there is NO volume between $3k and $2400.

For street cred on financials: My day job is income tax manager for 20+ billion revenue public company.

Edit: 2 new items brought to my attention. They will mark to market their Rivian loss which could trip up the algos that trade on headline #s. Also, $FDX earnings are out and guidance was not good.",78,u8atpk,2022-04-21T00:33:09Z,2022-04-21

9785,amzn,wallstreetbets,POST,"18k gains in April (BABA, AMZN, TWTR)","[All aboard the gain train.](https://imgur.com/a/NBityhG)

About 18k in gains since the beginning of this month. Felt like I actually was patient with my entries and saw through the noise on these trades. Already withdrew 10k for Roth, boomer brokerage, savings, and taxes. This is more money than I make in about 3 months of work, so this has been awesome.

**BABA 4/8 115c +$2,375**

(Bought at EOD and got a gap up the next day, sold at open).

**AMZN 4/14 3010c +$9,532.50**

(Bought this EOD last week when it was near 3000 because I like round number psychological supports. Moved up to 3120 the next day. I could have held out for about 10k more in gains, but oh well).

**TWTR 4/22 46p +$6,060**

(Opened these yesterday because TWTR talk was at a fever pitch on WSB/StockTwits, which means it's time for puts. Through everything I read, there's no way Elon's making this deal happen, he's the ultimate troll. Massive red candle hit today, I thought my eyes were deceiving me and then I sold at 2:11 pm.)",10,u7ho12,2022-04-19T22:44:21Z,2022-04-19

9798,amzn,wallstreetbets,POST,"Stock Discussion: AMZN held at 3,000 on Wednesday, up 3.15%. At what price did you buy AMZN stock?","The reason I invested in AMZN is simple because I used to be in the clothing import business and AMZN took over our business. So I can only buy their stock.

In April 2020, I bought 100 shares of AMZN at $1900. Holding until November of last year, I sold all AMZN shares at $3,500. The main reason is that Bezos sold AMZN stock.

&#x200B;

To be honest, the market has not been very good recently, and I think many people are worried about whether the stock market will crash again.

In early May, the Fed will raise interest rates again. With a rate hike of 50-75 basis points said, the market could again have unpredictable results.

I'm a conservative person, I wait for the market to drop and buy on dips. Another question was raised, so how much will the market fall, and what price range is better to buy in the future?

I think we can have a good discussion on this issue.",16,u3ffvw,2022-04-14T11:36:24Z,2022-04-14

9810,amzn,stocks,POST,"NFLX plummeted 35%, and its teammates, who were as stupid as pigs, dragged down FB, DIS, ROKU, and AMZN by themselves.","NFLX suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, sending its shares plunging 25% in extended trading amid fears that the groundbreaking streaming service may have had its best days.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

9834,amzn,stocks,POST,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","Follow-up to my MSFT/GOOGL/NVDA post earlier this week (resolution there was to keep all three but perhaps trim them some).  **This is part two, but will likely be the last such post for a while as I do not intend to bombard you with these types of posts (I know they might get annoying) but do value your feedback.**

What are your thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM?  By long-term I mean for the next 5-10 years, and taking into consideration various scenarios like stagflation, recessions, or on the flip side, an economic boom if Powell can figure out inflation and Putin loses his war quickly.

My preliminary thoughts:

* AMZN: Overall, I see it as a good stock with a weakening moat.  AWS is their crown jewel and will likely remain so, but they are facing increasing competition from MSFT, GOOGL and others (e.g. ORCL, IBM, but these are to a much lesser extent).  E-Commerce appears to be slower growth especially given the immense costs of capex (delivery, warehouses).  E-Commerce is facing increasing competition from others like TGT, WMT, and SHOP, and the first two of these are already big box stores and thus do not need to spend as much on capex to ramp up.  For example, TGT/WMT offer buy and pick up services, which while not as convenient as AMZN prime, is still pretty useful (I use it sometimes).  Bottom line, I fear AMZN's growth will be slower going forward, which does not bode well as its PE is also quite a bit higher than MSFT and GOOGL.

* ADBE: Its software is ubiquitous, but seems to have stalled out on growth.  My favorite segment of theirs is actually the Experience Cloud, which appears unique but is having inconsistent results.  Document Cloud faces heavy competition from Docusign, etc. and anyway is free for most users (Adobe Acrobat Reader) or already installed (meaning incremental revenue would have to come from fee increases and not necessarily new licenses).  Creative Cloud remains good, but it is mostly focused on 2D AFAIK.  If 3D imaging continues to gain steam, I see ADSK and U being better.  Bottom line and as with AMZN, competition and over-saturation are issues.

* CRM: It appears quite clear that its sales platform is saturated, and it appears that even Marc Benioff knows that (hence the Tableau and Slack acquisitions).  I see the Analytics Cloud as being potentially the biggest gamechanger of theirs as Tableau's competitors are rather weak and smaller companies (e.g. Alteryx).  I have heard that Microsoft has a competing product called PowerBI, but I don't know exactly how it stacks up to Tableau.  Not sure though if the Analytics Cloud will be enough to take CRM to significantly higher growth (e.g. 20%+ revenue growth yoy).",18,u4dsoz,2022-04-15T17:57:37Z,2022-04-15

I like the business that CRM has, and I like their CEO, but I think they overpaid for Slack, as well have a pretty high current and forward P/E.

I like the business of Amazon much more.  AWS prints money, and their ad business is growing like crazy.  I want to disclose that I do own AMZN but don't own CRM or ADBE, though I have been eyeing CRM lately.",5,u4dsoz,2022-04-15T19:04:08Z,2022-04-15

9839,amzn,stocks,COMMENT,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","I think a truly long-term investor need not worry too much about the current macro environment when evaluating these companies. Amazon looks fairly cheap; Adobe looks a little expensive. Both wonderful businesses. Haven‚Äôt analyzed CRM.

The thing about Amazon is that their current net income is comically low compared to what they could show if they wanted to. They also still have a lot of room for growth in all of their major businesses (e.g. ads, AWS, third party sellers, etc). They will likely face some temporary headwinds from supply chain and inflation issues, maybe some upward wage pressure across the board, maybe some regulatory issues. I think they may have some issues with retaining top talent given the low wages, poor benefits. I also worry about the fact that we have to depend on the management to transition from growth mode to earnings mode without destroying too much capital along the way.

All of that said, my DCF with relatively conservative assumptions still tells me it‚Äôs cheap, so I say it‚Äôs cheap.",8,u4dsoz,2022-04-15T18:52:24Z,2022-04-15

I see companies with Salesforce deployments who after 3 to 5 years literally are deleting everything in their instance and refilling it with a smaller but new dataset. They have so many products and few of them are well developed. Salesforce will still be used at a lot of companies in 10 years but I suspect their growth will stop in the next few years. Salesforce is really like a crappy low code platform for a lot of companies but other, better platforms are coming out. Palantir, Snowflake, Podio, iPAAS and other apps are all great examples of companies taking custom app mindshare away from custom Salesforce apps.

CRM is basically like IBM. No one got fired for buying IBM consulting and same idea for Salesforce. But that isn't a great growth story. CRM trades at a 127 PE ratio and IBM trades at a 12 PE ratio.",2,u4dsoz,2022-04-17T05:00:05Z,2022-04-17

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe.

9887,snap,wallstreetbets,POST,$SNAP bull case for earnings rip,"While everyone is sitting around wondering why they didn't buy Netflix puts when the play was so obvious, let's regroup and take a look at Snapchat.

Remember what happened last ER? FB tanked and dragged a bunch of other stock down with it for no good reason other than panic. Snap dropped a ton because social media was 'dead'. Then they posted their first profit ever and rocketed 58% the next day once everyone realized Snap was not only unrelated to FB's sinking ship, but is taking their lost market share.

Now lets get to why Snap could rocket. Traffic is way up from last quarter across the board, but more importantly, **desktop** traffic is up by 11m last quarter. You may be wondering, who the hell uses Snapchat on desktop? Advertisers, that's who. If you have to generate creative, upload files, view reports, download lead files, retrieve invoices to submit to accounting etc - it's gotta be on desktop.

Marketing types are scrambling to find replacements for the eyes they are losing on Facebook. My guess is lots of new advertiser accounts created right after the FB fiasco.

EPS last time around was 0.01, a huge improvement. Avg estimate now is 0.01 which means a big beat is feasible, combined with the NFXL drop we might see a nice move.

Positions:  
10x 4/22 43/48 Bull Call Spread   
5x 4/22 -29p/34c Risk Reversal (if I'm wrong I'll take assignment and sell CC's in between shifts at Wendy's)  


TLDR: I bought calls, you should buy puts.

Oh snap‚Ä¶,"Gary Gensler reminds me so much of Lanny Breuer: the deputy attorney general in the Obama years who came across as so ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô. Trying their ‚Äòvery best‚Äô to prosecute those responsible for the GFC of 2008. In the end, got nothing done.   


They have that same weasel face and weasel words. False sincerity. ‚ÄòGive me time‚Äô.   


Gensler‚Äòs mantra is competition. He uses it all the time. Competition will solve all the fraud.   


How to DESTROY Gensler? Doggedly refuse to let him use the competition word. Competition is NOT a substitute for enforcement. Every time he brings up the competition word, cut him off and say he is deflecting. Gensler without the word competition is a deflating ballon.",265,u5f754,2022-04-17T08:22:02Z,2022-04-17

Oh snap‚Ä¶,"There was a lot of push to support Gary Gensler, to let him do his job, to praise him when things looked like they were going somewhere.

We are over a year past the sneeze and all we have are a few senate hearings that lead to... what? Meanwhile, he deflects to climate change when we're focused on Payment For Order Flow. (Notice how Jon Stewart did a ""The Problem"" show on climate change and recycling RIGHT AFTER TALKING WITH GARY GENSLER, showing how a lot of the climate change stuff that's pushed onto the common person is bupkis and the big corpos are the driving force behind it. It all comes full circle.)

I still think we need to be submitting research and information to the SEC. At the end of the day, that research, that Due Diligence, will be CRITICAL in showing how useless and ineffective the SEC is, how fraudulent the FED is, and how we need big change in all of these systems. Without submitting the DD to the SEC in as dumbed-down a way as possible, congress can sweep all this under the rug. Every page and comment sent the SEC's way about issues like short selling, naked shorting, payment for order flow, dark pools, and more, is another day that Kenneth Cordele Griffin of Citadel, Steve Cohen of Point 72 and more will spend behind bars and another nail in the coffin for the ineffective SEC.",2,u5f754,2022-04-17T21:26:14Z,2022-04-17

In all three other instances the spike has been followed by a 20% volatility increase within two trading days afterwards.,"I started to notice a pattern related to the rogue VIX spikes that will appear completely out of nowhere to cause market sell-offs before getting pushed back down by the Fed to keep the markets healthy.   In the three other times that these have suddenly leaked out on green market days, there has been a VIX increase of 18-20% occur within 2 trading days afterwards.  The spike that leaked out is not random, it's almost a glitch in the system and offers us a hint that something is about to happen to the markets volatility very soon.

10042,vix,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",75,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

The key takeaways today for SPY were that 1. 447.2 is a MAJOR resistance that is going to take some time to get through and 2. 444 is a hella strong support that is also going to be tough to get through with 445 being noteworthy too. SPY continues to enjoy this sideways trading and to be honest I do too. I killed it today scalping these run ups and downs today. Ill take a day like this every single day.

Despite SPYs ability to do it today it FAILED to break the bear channel. This bear channel is utilizing the two most recent ‚Äúhighs‚Äù from March 29th and April 5th. That lower highs trend is still yet to be broken. Resistance will be at 447 tomorrow which is quite a peculiar resistance line with how strong that rejected us numerous times today. Support remains near 430 tomorrow.

Despite the bears managing to close SPY red today at 0.07% the bulls made headway today. The bulls were able to break above the daily 100 ema at 446 today. However, they failed to close above it and settled for a close above the daily 8, 20, and 50ema which sit at 444. 27/ 444.38 and 443.31. Overall despite the sideways burning day SPY did have bullish momentum. Tomorrow if bulls can break this above 448 we will see the daily bear channel broken and I do believe riding off of Teslas great earnings we could see a rip to 460 next week or end of month.

Apple enjoyed a sideways day too, however, struggled quite a bit more then SPY did today overall. We saw Apple reject the upward resistance line which is also its daily 20ema at 168.95 today. However, apple bulls are stacking candles on top of eachother now and I do suspect we will see this bear channel broke, especially with good news from the tesla earnings.  Apple closing above its daily 8ema is a bullish momentum move also. I fully expect apple to be able to have a green bull day near 170.5.

QQQ continues to stack candles higher also and appears to be establishing some bullish momentum. As I have mentioned before have suspect that the 338 level was the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù for now. I fully expect to see 370-375 end of month without any bad news catalysts. QQQ while breaking the daily 8ema and touching the daily 20ema failed to close above either today. QQQ bulls will need to take this opportunity to close above those key resistance lines tomorrow in order to see a bull week next week.

The VIX enjoyed nothing but sideways trading all day today sticking to a tight $2.50 range almost all day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aonzikkurru81.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ebb40b0e7e49d05255c0134a8f2bb55cb44fc50

The VIX is now trading within its recent ‚Äúmean‚Äù with its recent range being 18.5 to 24.8. This lower vix is not only going to cause less volatility and smaller swings/ daily moves but its going to result in some more of these sideways boring days. With the VIX close to 18.5 then it has been since April 5th I will look for the bulls to take this as an opportunity to get this back to 450+. 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a hella good day on the server. I made/ called out 11 trades today and 10 of which were profitable (one did close at 0% but it was not red and I count that as a win). Here is my daily trade log

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 13%

4/20/2022 Call 2dte 24%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 10%

4/20/2022 Put 5dte -10%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 25%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 60%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 50%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (apple) 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 18%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 8%

This is I believe one of if not the most trades I have made in a single day of trading yet and with a 90.9% win rate on the day. I did throw two 0dte in there today but sticking to no 0 dte and a smaller position size of 2500/ trade has made a massive difference this week. I also had some people I feel ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù of my actual trades and my log so today you will get a screenshot of my TOS. 

Today as you can see I actually played two Tesla ‚ÄúLottos‚Äù I had planned these to be overnight puts for earnings but I was able to close one at 50% and one at 18% which pretty much allowed me to play the current 4/22 855P I have open for free. Obviously unless sentiment changes over night those are going to take quite a massive hit at open but with a big enough IV pump ill be content with a 50% loss on it. But it is what it is and was a true one contract LOTTO paid for by my daily tesla put profits. 

Hyperwheel I was able to sell 3 puts and close at 50% profits for an additional $203.64 in premium today. I currently have 3 puts open sitting at 30% profit I suspect I will roll tomorrow. 

hyperwheel return is 4.04% 

buy and hold is 2.06%

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&#x200B;

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. 

&#x200B;

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn‚Äôt any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",22,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

10107,qqq,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-18-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA"," If someone was to ask me to ‚Äúdescribe a sideways day‚Äù I would show them todays chart. IT was the definition of sideways from open to start. One of the only days I can remember in a very a long time maybe ever when SPY made a HOD, LOD, retest HOD, retested LOD and then finishe din the dead middle of both of them‚Ä¶ Some sideways trading for sure.

You could have bought a 0dte put or 0dte call at open today and with enough patience been profitable very few days can you say that. So what did we learn from today? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xw5i37cidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=612e88c2919519334f328db0fa8242d569f3fb06

I referenced it on my pre-market analysis that we remain within the bear channel still with a now resistance of 440.7 to 441.7 and now support at 431.6 to 430.

Overall we started at the more support side of channel and have now finished more closer to the resistance side but overall we have no solid direction just from the intraday chart. I look for tomorrow to have a confirmed support or confirmed resistance test. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7103hvucidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bdabf47603dae71a8c3d3f26322c3b000d66b7

The intraday volume today was unbelievably low and was saved somewhat by the last 15minute candle but we still finished near 66mil total volume which is the 2nd lowest volume day since April 4th and March 24th. 

As you can see I am working on a theory we are going to bounce off support near 428 to 433 and from there work back to the 450 to 460 range. Arguably we looked poised end of day today to flush to 433 but we ended up reversing at the last minute there. 

We did remain in the bear channel with our next bear channel support at exactly 433.

Bears managed to close a FULL candle below the daily 200ema of 439.96 without even breaking it at all intraday which actually is a fairly bearish move overall and should see a lower push without any bullish sentiment overnight. Markets seemed to have rallied aggressively right at market close though. Being under the 200ema now we really don‚Äôt have another support that‚Äôs strong which is why I an using the January lows at the next logical support. 

Bulls will look to close back over 440 tomorrow and bears will look to get an even lower close near 433 tomorrow.

Apple too was a victim of sideways trading with a strong $3 range seeing a very similar movement of spy today, but a little less dramatic. 

&#x200B;

Apple did manage to close a red candle today (green on chart) but it‚Äôs a -0.13% day for Apple. 

Apple was early morning looking very strong ready to hold over its daily 100ema of 165.66 but quickly fell back below it and from there never broke it again. Todays candle for apple closed similarly to the candle from March 14th which is a hammer candle and COULD signal further upside for apple this week ahead. 

Bulls will need apple to close back above the daily 100ema to prevent any further retracements. 

Bears will look to capitalize on this down day with another red candle with a price target of the late January lows of 155 to 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j16myvleidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f88f39c078c10f31e2f062372ebaa0a919efea

QQQ today had a similar day as spy and apple clocking in a small 0.08% green day but seeing a major after market pop. 

Bears were able to make a new recent low for QQQ and will look to continue to capitalize on that this week. The candle closing inside the middle of the channel allows room for both directions easily tomorrow. However, it did finish a large bodies doji. Which after almost two weeks of red could signal a reversal tomorrow for green. 

I mentioned the January lows for apple and spy. QQQ is ahead of the game and today broke below the first low of 338.3 with its final low being 334.5. If we were to see QQQ close below 334.5 this week I would suspect we could see a further sell off down near 318 to 330 in the coming weeks. 

Bulls really need to get a nice green day tomorrow here to be able to break the daily 8ema. Until that resistance is broken QQQ is in some serious red trouble. 

&#x200B;

After a pretty significant gap up at open the VIX spent most of its day unwinding from its high of 24.6 to 21.98 end of day, another 12% range day for the VIX. Seems to be pretty common we have these huge VIX swings. It is slightly surprising with how massively the VIX unwound today that SPY did not have a green day. With the VIX down near its normal level and where it clung to end of last week we should see less volatility tomorrow and again the VIX should be a great guide for action to come. 

10% challenge-

Mondays historically is a day I struggle with profit wise and its probably cause lately Mondays have been anything but ‚Äútrendy.‚Äù Like we saw today, however, I was able to pull 1.5x daily profit goal so I cant be too upset about that at all. Lost a little on an end of day greedy put play but overall a great day despite the weird sideways day we had. 

4dte apple put= -26%

4dte spy call= 12%

4dte spy call= 12%

11dte apple call= -8%

4dte spy put= 20%

4dte spy put= -15%

2dte spy call 10%

Today I also officially began the hyperwheel utilizing the MES futures. I have three current open contracts. Two I sold together are sitting at +32% and one is sitting +12%. Looking to see if we continue the after hours green tonight to be able to roll my first profitable sold put or if we continue downside. I am excited for this venture of the hyper wheel. 

Overall this weekend after digging through the discords theta thread and compiling it all into one document (soon to be available just getting final touches!) I decided it was time to do it heads on. I am currently running 2:1 leverage and feel fairly comfortable with that leverage right now. As I continue day trading and with my monthly goal being $10k plus I was finding myself struggling with an ‚Äúend goal.‚Äù Yes of course goals to be ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù BUT what number? I didn‚Äôt have a number and I can only trade so many options and with this market im not comfortable upping my capital. I had plans to VTI and chill all profits but now that my capital has grown significantly I am at a good place to start the hyperwheel. I find the effort worth the reward in the end and I look forward to giving this venture a go. I will be adding my daily hyperwheel progress to my TA from now on for you to track and those who are curious to see it real world.",17,u6qx8f,2022-04-18T23:39:02Z,2022-04-18

10119,qqq,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qx249ku5flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=536a61250fbef3166d9bc55010541985bffb8c82

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8h8w8sk8flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad9975294ee40cd03342febaf5cb1275945383f

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. 

&#x200B;

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",72,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps‚Ä¶ 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it‚Äôs the roaring 20s again‚Ä¶

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours‚Ä¶ its still a break and that‚Äôs a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken‚Ä¶ lets see if we can find a new trend or not‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked‚Ä¶

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green √† red. Red. Red. √† green -> red. Red √† green √† red red red √† green √† red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)‚Ä¶ we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p‚Ä¶ There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k‚Ä¶. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k‚Ä¶ even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. 

&#x200B;

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. 

&#x200B;

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis‚Ä¶ a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again‚Ä¶ definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gyfddp8ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38157a204b956632b698a1e2b2cf5100e80d564

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out. 

&#x200B;

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

&#x200B;

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don‚Äôt like to hold positions over night‚Ä¶ 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there‚Ä¶ but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don‚Äôt believe in what you are trading and you don‚Äôt believe in the move that‚Äôs about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",38,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

10185,appl,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-20-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA (with p/l screenshots)"," Day three of essentially sideways range trading clocked in for the week. This is the most sideways I have seen the market day after day in a while. I think the market is a little on edge to say the least right now with earnings approaching and especially with the anticipation of Tesla earnings which are live now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9jcxe2qrru81.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e46d1b878ed7ac9e3693703a6864a7f42d71e9b

Tesla essentially killed it with earnings! I didn‚Äôt get to listen to the conference call but I hear they are thinking of a self driving vehicle subscription. Otherwise I didn‚Äôt hear any note worthy conference call news. 

&#x200B;

Being that its up 4.58% currently after market I don‚Äôt think there was anything scary either.

The key takeaways today for SPY were that 1. 447.2 is a MAJOR resistance that is going to take some time to get through and 2. 444 is a hella strong support that is also going to be tough to get through with 445 being noteworthy too. SPY continues to enjoy this sideways trading and to be honest I do too. I killed it today scalping these run ups and downs today. Ill take a day like this every single day.

Despite SPYs ability to do it today it FAILED to break the bear channel. This bear channel is utilizing the two most recent ‚Äúhighs‚Äù from March 29th and April 5th. That lower highs trend is still yet to be broken. Resistance will be at 447 tomorrow which is quite a peculiar resistance line with how strong that rejected us numerous times today. Support remains near 430 tomorrow.

Despite the bears managing to close SPY red today at 0.07% the bulls made headway today. The bulls were able to break above the daily 100 ema at 446 today. However, they failed to close above it and settled for a close above the daily 8, 20, and 50ema which sit at 444. 27/ 444.38 and 443.31. Overall despite the sideways burning day SPY did have bullish momentum. Tomorrow if bulls can break this above 448 we will see the daily bear channel broken and I do believe riding off of Teslas great earnings we could see a rip to 460 next week or end of month.

Apple enjoyed a sideways day too, however, struggled quite a bit more then SPY did today overall. We saw Apple reject the upward resistance line which is also its daily 20ema at 168.95 today. However, apple bulls are stacking candles on top of eachother now and I do suspect we will see this bear channel broke, especially with good news from the tesla earnings.  Apple closing above its daily 8ema is a bullish momentum move also. I fully expect apple to be able to have a green bull day near 170.5. 

&#x200B;

QQQ continues to stack candles higher also and appears to be establishing some bullish momentum. As I have mentioned before have suspect that the 338 level was the ‚Äúbottom‚Äù for now. I fully expect to see 370-375 end of month without any bad news catalysts. QQQ while breaking the daily 8ema and touching the daily 20ema failed to close above either today. QQQ bulls will need to take this opportunity to close above those key resistance lines tomorrow in order to see a bull week next week. 

&#x200B;

The VIX enjoyed nothing but sideways trading all day today sticking to a tight $2.50 range almost all day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aonzikkurru81.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ebb40b0e7e49d05255c0134a8f2bb55cb44fc50

The VIX is now trading within its recent ‚Äúmean‚Äù with its recent range being 18.5 to 24.8. This lower vix is not only going to cause less volatility and smaller swings/ daily moves but its going to result in some more of these sideways boring days. With the VIX close to 18.5 then it has been since April 5th I will look for the bulls to take this as an opportunity to get this back to 450+. 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a hella good day on the server. I made/ called out 11 trades today and 10 of which were profitable (one did close at 0% but it was not red and I count that as a win). Here is my daily trade log

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 13%

4/20/2022 Call 2dte 24%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 10%

4/20/2022 Put 5dte -10%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 25%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 60%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 50%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (apple) 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 18%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 8%

This is I believe one of if not the most trades I have made in a single day of trading yet and with a 90.9% win rate on the day. I did throw two 0dte in there today but sticking to no 0 dte and a smaller position size of 2500/ trade has made a massive difference this week. I also had some people I feel ‚Äúskeptical‚Äù of my actual trades and my log so today you will get a screenshot of my TOS. 

Today as you can see I actually played two Tesla ‚ÄúLottos‚Äù I had planned these to be overnight puts for earnings but I was able to close one at 50% and one at 18% which pretty much allowed me to play the current 4/22 855P I have open for free. Obviously unless sentiment changes over night those are going to take quite a massive hit at open but with a big enough IV pump ill be content with a 50% loss on it. But it is what it is and was a true one contract LOTTO paid for by my daily tesla put profits. 

Hyperwheel I was able to sell 3 puts and close at 50% profits for an additional $203.64 in premium today. I currently have 3 puts open sitting at 30% profit I suspect I will roll tomorrow. 

hyperwheel return is 4.04% 

buy and hold is 2.06%

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it‚Ä¶ SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&#x200B;

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night.

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn‚Äôt any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",19,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

10230,appl,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-18-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA"," If someone was to ask me to ‚Äúdescribe a sideways day‚Äù I would show them todays chart. IT was the definition of sideways from open to start. One of the only days I can remember in a very a long time maybe ever when SPY made a HOD, LOD, retest HOD, retested LOD and then finishe din the dead middle of both of them‚Ä¶ Some sideways trading for sure.

You could have bought a 0dte put or 0dte call at open today and with enough patience been profitable very few days can you say that. So what did we learn from today? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xw5i37cidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=612e88c2919519334f328db0fa8242d569f3fb06

I referenced it on my pre-market analysis that we remain within the bear channel still with a now resistance of 440.7 to 441.7 and now support at 431.6 to 430.

Overall we started at the more support side of channel and have now finished more closer to the resistance side but overall we have no solid direction just from the intraday chart. I look for tomorrow to have a confirmed support or confirmed resistance test. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7103hvucidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bdabf47603dae71a8c3d3f26322c3b000d66b7

The intraday volume today was unbelievably low and was saved somewhat by the last 15minute candle but we still finished near 66mil total volume which is the 2nd lowest volume day since April 4th and March 24th. 

As you can see I am working on a theory we are going to bounce off support near 428 to 433 and from there work back to the 450 to 460 range. Arguably we looked poised end of day today to flush to 433 but we ended up reversing at the last minute there. 

We did remain in the bear channel with our next bear channel support at exactly 433.

Bears managed to close a FULL candle below the daily 200ema of 439.96 without even breaking it at all intraday which actually is a fairly bearish move overall and should see a lower push without any bullish sentiment overnight. Markets seemed to have rallied aggressively right at market close though. Being under the 200ema now we really don‚Äôt have another support that‚Äôs strong which is why I an using the January lows at the next logical support. 

Bulls will look to close back over 440 tomorrow and bears will look to get an even lower close near 433 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple too was a victim of sideways trading with a strong $3 range seeing a very similar movement of spy today, but a little less dramatic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9j28a2eidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c4ef3c8f3ecef360d10cc4e5ab5cf9068e4a0b

Apple did manage to close a red candle today (green on chart) but it‚Äôs a -0.13% day for Apple. 

Apple was early morning looking very strong ready to hold over its daily 100ema of 165.66 but quickly fell back below it and from there never broke it again. Todays candle for apple closed similarly to the candle from March 14th which is a hammer candle and COULD signal further upside for apple this week ahead. 

Bulls will need apple to close back above the daily 100ema to prevent any further retracements. 

Bears will look to capitalize on this down day with another red candle with a price target of the late January lows of 155 to 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j16myvleidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f88f39c078c10f31e2f062372ebaa0a919efea

QQQ today had a similar day as spy and apple clocking in a small 0.08% green day but seeing a major after market pop. 

Bears were able to make a new recent low for QQQ and will look to continue to capitalize on that this week. The candle closing inside the middle of the channel allows room for both directions easily tomorrow. However, it did finish a large bodies doji. Which after almost two weeks of red could signal a reversal tomorrow for green. 

I mentioned the January lows for apple and spy. QQQ is ahead of the game and today broke below the first low of 338.3 with its final low being 334.5. If we were to see QQQ close below 334.5 this week I would suspect we could see a further sell off down near 318 to 330 in the coming weeks. 

Bulls really need to get a nice green day tomorrow here to be able to break the daily 8ema. Until that resistance is broken QQQ is in some serious red trouble. 

&#x200B;

After a pretty significant gap up at open the VIX spent most of its day unwinding from its high of 24.6 to 21.98 end of day, another 12% range day for the VIX. Seems to be pretty common we have these huge VIX swings. It is slightly surprising with how massively the VIX unwound today that SPY did not have a green day. With the VIX down near its normal level and where it clung to end of last week we should see less volatility tomorrow and again the VIX should be a great guide for action to come. 

10% challenge-

Mondays historically is a day I struggle with profit wise and its probably cause lately Mondays have been anything but ‚Äútrendy.‚Äù Like we saw today, however, I was able to pull 1.5x daily profit goal so I cant be too upset about that at all. Lost a little on an end of day greedy put play but overall a great day despite the weird sideways day we had. 

4dte apple put= -26%

4dte spy call= 12%

4dte spy call= 12%

11dte apple call= -8%

4dte spy put= 20%

4dte spy put= -15%

2dte spy call 10%

Today I also officially began the hyperwheel utilizing the MES futures. I have three current open contracts. Two I sold together are sitting at +32% and one is sitting +12%. Looking to see if we continue the after hours green tonight to be able to roll my first profitable sold put or if we continue downside. I am excited for this venture of the hyper wheel. 

Overall this weekend after digging through the discords theta thread and compiling it all into one document (soon to be available just getting final touches!) I decided it was time to do it heads on. I am currently running 2:1 leverage and feel fairly comfortable with that leverage right now. As I continue day trading and with my monthly goal being $10k plus I was finding myself struggling with an ‚Äúend goal.‚Äù Yes of course goals to be ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù BUT what number? I didn‚Äôt have a number and I can only trade so many options and with this market im not comfortable upping my capital. I had plans to VTI and chill all profits but now that my capital has grown significantly I am at a good place to start the hyperwheel. I find the effort worth the reward in the end and I look forward to giving this venture a go. I will be adding my daily hyperwheel progress to my TA from now on for you to track and those who are curious to see it real world.",17,u6qx8f,2022-04-18T23:39:02Z,2022-04-18

10252,appl,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something‚Ä¶ In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That‚Äôs a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5cbff1k4flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c88e247274869141c67e29ea0f55e342e3a046bf

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to ‚Äúrest‚Äù before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move‚Ä¶ Spy dipping to 440.6 √† it involves a rest period‚Ä¶ SPY breaking back above the 8ema‚Ä¶ Spy breaking to 442.3 √† then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move‚Ä¶ so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g6kk5555flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a29142cfd1fc794a4766fe400267a253eafb9f76

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qx249ku5flt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=536a61250fbef3166d9bc55010541985bffb8c82

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 √† $85 √† 80 √† and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet‚Ä¶ some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it‚Ä¶ Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high‚Ä¶ Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least‚Ä¶ the QQQ‚Äôs. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the ‚Äúshoulder‚Äù yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this‚Ä¶ I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my ‚Äúlevels‚Äù on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for ‚Äúyou are a great trader but you aren‚Äôt a weather forecaster.‚Äù Me being me who is dead inside and doesn‚Äôt get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn‚Äôt say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and ‚Äúcommitment‚Äù on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information‚Ä¶

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That‚Äôs quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",75,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps‚Ä¶ 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it‚Äôs the roaring 20s again‚Ä¶

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours‚Ä¶ its still a break and that‚Äôs a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken‚Ä¶ lets see if we can find a new trend or not‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked‚Ä¶

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green √† red. Red. Red. √† green -> red. Red √† green √† red red red √† green √† red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)‚Ä¶ we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p‚Ä¶ There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k‚Ä¶. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k‚Ä¶ even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting.

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57.

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis‚Ä¶ a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again‚Ä¶ definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don‚Äôt like to hold positions over night‚Ä¶ 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there‚Ä¶ but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don‚Äôt believe in what you are trading and you don‚Äôt believe in the move that‚Äôs about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",40,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

If you have MetaMask on an iPhone or Mac, then you're likely also using iCloud backup.  MetaMask backup your Valut containing your seed by default, so turn that off from Settings\\Profile\\iCloud\\Manage Storage!

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I have been following this developing story on Twitter about a user that lost $650K yesterday due to the following phishing method with others coming forward claiming that the same has also happened to them.

**Background**  

When you create a wallet using MetaMask on an iPhone, the app will create a JSON containing your wallet, this is stored on your device.  Most users use iCloud to automatically backup their phone and app data, but unbeknown to many users, MetaMask include this file as part of the backup.  From a google search, this isn't new, it was discovered in 2019, but MetaMask have today acknowledged (addressed) it [HERE](https://nitter.net/MetaMask) after a number of users were targeted resulting in lost funds.

**Phishing Method**

For the user that lost $650K, it appears to be a very sophisticated attack. They fell victim as follows...

The malicious attacker requested several password resets against their AppleID/iCloud generating several emails to their account.  From there, they using a spoofed caller id to call the victim and claimed that they were from Apple and calling about suspicious activity on their account.  They asked them to generate their MFA one time pass to confirm that they were the account owner.   The hacker used this to reset the password and take control of the Apple account.  From there, they were able to restore from a backup and drain the wallet of all funds.

10444,appl,stocks,POST,Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay,"When the Apple M1 series came out, lots of people were saying that x86 is doomed, Intel and AMD will be out of business and every big tech companies will be designing their own ARM-based processor. In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:

1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and experience to make the M1 series. Few other companies can afford to spend that amount of money and time do built a design team as capable as Apple's, even if they could, it could still be more expensive than just buying processors from Intel or AMD.
2. It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture: processors are expensive, but the time of competent software engineers is even more expensive. Good software engineers are required if you want to migrate your software to a different ISA and have it performing well, and they are expensive and rare. It makes more financial sense for companies to assign these engineers to other purposes than to re-write software that runs fine on existing hardware. On top of that, most companies doesn't have the complete control over their platform like Apple does on OSX and iOS, which would makes this task even harder, more expensive and time-consuming.
3. Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node: Apple started using the TSMC N5 process more than 1 year earlier than almost everybody else, which is a significant contributing factor to the efficiency advantage of the M1 series. Even datacenter products with extremely high margin such as the AMD EPYC and Nvidia A100 are one generation behind in terms of process node. It takes an insane amount of money to design a processor on the most advanced process node, hundreds of millions for N5, billions is expected for N3. If processor vendors like AMD and Nvidia can't race Apple to the most advanced node, processors for in-house usage by Google, Amazon or Microsoft definitely won't have the volume to do so.
4. The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains ""only"" roughly 54 billion transistors.  While the M1 Max is powerful, it's definitely not as powerful as the RTX 3080 and 5900X combined, even if it contains more transistors. If only fabbing cost is considered, a M1 Max is more expensive to manufacture than 2 RTX 3080 since the cost per transistor stopped dropping since 28nm. The design of M1 series sacrifices transistor efficiency for energy efficiency, which makes sense for mobile products, but for HPC applications better transistor efficiency should be more desirable. AMD and Nvidia products are still more efficient in terms of computing power to manufacturing cost ratio.

In conclusion, the M1 series is the result of Apple pouring tremendous amount of resource over a long time, which most companies can't afford to do. Even if they could, it would probably make more financial sense to simply purchase processors from existing vendors.",221,u44fqe,2022-04-15T09:44:55Z,2022-04-15

This isn‚Äôt super true especially for higher levels of the stack. Device drivers and low level OS code, yeah, but for everything else it‚Äôs not hard to port to a different architecture. It‚Äôs way way harder to port to a different OS or even graphics library. The real cost is testing cycles and infrastructure, not the code.

Linux already runs well on ARM and Microsoft has windows ARM. In the medium term, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if more server side stuff moves to Linux on ARM. Performance per watt especially considering cooling costs is far superior on ARM and single thread performance isn‚Äôt that important. I‚Äôm surprised it isn‚Äôt the standard already.",22,u44fqe,2022-04-15T16:00:50Z,2022-04-15
10448,appl,stocks,COMMENT,Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay,"I don't really disagree, but I think you are overstating things.  So here are my disagreements.

> It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team

Agreed, but I think there are more than a few companies that could do that (or arguably already have).  Samsung, Broadcom, qualcom, or nVidia to name a few.

> It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture

Less time now-a-days than ever before.  Particularly if you are already targeting an existing architecture like ARM.  Apple didn't make a new ARM instruction set.

Very little modern software is written in such a way to make it dependent on the instruction set.

> Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node.

While true, the same companies I pointed out earlier ARE already using those advanced nodes from TSMC.  Really, the only difference is they've not chosen to enter the server market.

However, that's something that's been changing as of late.  Because of ARM's somewhat natural energy efficiency you are starting to see cloud providers offer ARM based systems.

It's really only a matter of time for some of these mobile manufacturers to decide they want a large piece of the pie.

> The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains ""only"" roughly 54 billion transistors.

You can't really point at transistor numbers and draw much meaningful conclusions.  M1 Max is both a CPU + GPU.  Further, it has a rather monstrously sized L2 cache (24MB).  The 5900X has a 4MB L2.  That's not really being inefficient with transistors.

But even so.. so what?  Transistor count might push up die space requirements which decreases yield, but that's not really terribly impactful on the bottom line.",9,u44fqe,2022-04-15T16:00:19Z,2022-04-15

I think Amazon, Google and Microsoft can use this model for servers, if they want, but designing and maintaining new chips is super expensive, so if Intel or amd are making chips that are ""good enough"", there's not much cost justification to maintain the design team. Worst case for them would be if they spent billions on a home brew chip, then Intel releases something better that same year.",1,u44fqe,2022-04-15T14:43:23Z,2022-04-15

You make reasonable points, but the news seems to point in the opposite direction.

10470,appl,stocks,POST,Facebook parent Meta set to take nearly 50% cut from virtual sales ‚Äî and Apple is calling it out,"Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs intent to take a nearly 50% cut of digital asset sales within its emerging metaverse is drawing widespread criticism from developers and longtime nemesis Apple Inc. Meta FB, +0.40% said in a blog post Monday it is allowing a handful of Horizon Worlds creators to sell virtual assets that could eventually include NFTs. Virtual-reality platform Horizon Worlds is considered an integral piece of Meta‚Äôs unfolding metaverse. The company said it will take up to 47.5% on each transaction, which includes a ‚Äúhardware platform fee‚Äù of 30% via its Meta Quest Store, as well as a 17.5% cut on Horizon Worlds.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs a pretty competitive rate in the market. We believe in the other platforms being able to have their share,‚Äù Vivek Sharma, Meta‚Äôs vice president of Horizon, told The Verge. But Meta‚Äôs plan immediately drew blowback from developers ‚Äî who pointed out NFT marketplace OpenSea takes a 2.5% cut of each transaction while LooksRare charges 2% ‚Äî and some pointed comments from antagonist Apple AAPL, +1.63%.

‚ÄúMeta has repeatedly taken aim at Apple for charging developers a 30% commission for in-app purchases in the App Store ‚Äî and have used small businesses and creators as a scapegoat at every turn,‚Äù Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in an email to MarketWatch. ‚ÄúNow ‚Äî Meta seeks to charge those same creators significantly more than any other platform. \[Meta‚Äôs\] announcement lays bare Meta‚Äôs hypocrisy. It goes to show that while they seek to use Apple‚Äôs platform for free, they happily take from the creators and small businesses that use their own.‚Äù

Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has blasted Apple for charging developers 30% for in-app purchases on the App Store. ‚ÄúAs we build for the metaverse, we‚Äôre focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,‚Äù he said in November. ‚ÄúThe 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we‚Äôre updating our subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.‚Äù

Underscoring the reaction of developers, Blockparty CEO Vladislav Ginzburg told MarketWatch: ‚ÄúFacebook keeps all media uploaded to it, retains all user data and owns every step of the process to sell to marketers. Rather than enable creators to share in the value they bring to Facebook, their goal is to take half of the sale. No thanks.‚Äù

10486,appl,Superstonk,POST,"""The Apple, doesn't fall too far from the tree."" Steve Jobs, in a short video, discussing ""Consultants"" lack of ownership leading to ""factional company value.""","Hello my fine fellow apes.  With all of the recent revelations surrounding consultants and their role in driving company value into the ground, I started digging deeper to see how far the distaste of consultants has spread across tech leaders.

We all know our very own RC has a HUGE distaste for Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and has made it VERY CLEAR he intends to *take them on* in a very public way. This got me thinking a bit. With his recent tweet about the apple falling from the tree (linked below), I busted out the good ole browser window and started digging onto consultants and Apple.

I quickly found an old Steve Jobs video where he offers his take on consultants and the lack of ownership/value consultants provide their ""clients"". (video linked below)

Almost foreshadowing the APE community, Steve uses a, ""Banana"" reference to explain his position a bit easier for the audience! 

Lastly, at the end of the clip...Steve makes a comment that instantly grabbed my attention.  Steve said, ""\[Consultants\] are a variable expense, and in hard times you find yourself....."" then there is crowd laughter before video is over.  Basically implying that when times are tough, you show them the door!

As Apples highest individual stock owner, it makes me wonder how much RC has been directly/indirectly influenced by Steve Jobs over the years, particularly on the consulting front....

I think that this is not only screaming SOMETHING about Apple, but symbolic to how the top .1% has excess amounts of money, and what that means about them.

Idk. This has me inspired asf at 2AM & I could be completely wrong. Oh well, I love Ryan Cohen and Forest Gump. 

- also, I‚Äôll never forget when I knew Ryan Cohen was in on this journey with Apes until he tweeted the south park clip & it had the ‚ÄúYou bastards killed kenny‚Äù or something like that.
