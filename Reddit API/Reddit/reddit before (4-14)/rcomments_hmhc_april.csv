Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company

We are investigating whether the directors of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Company (Nasdaq: HMHC) (“HMHC”) acted in the best interests of HMHC shareholders in approving the sale of HMHC to Veritas Capital (“Veritas”) for $21.00 per share in cash through a tender offer.

If you remain a HMHC shareholder and have questions about your legal rights, please contact us via the form below to discuss your options at no charge.

Why is there an investigation?
On February 22, 2022, HMHC announced an agreement for Veritas to purchase all of the outstanding shares of HMHC for $21.00 per share in cash through a tender offer. The agreement has been approved by the HMHC board.

Our investigation concerns whether HMHC’s board acted in the best interests of HMHC shareholders in approving the sale to Veritas, including whether the acquisition price adequately compensates HMHC shareholders, and whether all information regarding approval of the transaction has been fully disclosed.

In particular, according to a discounted cash flow analysis of HMHC by the Simply Wall Street research firm, the fair value of HMHC is $46.17 per share."

517,wallstreetbets,HMHC $16k LOSS,1.0,tydwqg,2022-04-08T00:24:50Z,"Okay, this is theory, but I've been racking my brain all day trying to figure out in what universe this tenders at $21. It made no sense. Then I realized it made no sense IF everything was on the up-and-up.....  
  
So, the HMHC board unanimously votes for this using numbers that came in just before Q4 earnings and shows a much lower valuation. The board knew the Q4 numbers, they just chose to ignore them since they weren't public yet. The reason they used them, was because Veritas was paying them a HUGE bonus if this went through at $21. I mean, if I'm gonna get a fat 6-7 figure check as a bonus for this thing passing cheap, I'm prolly gonna try to pass it cheap. I mean, fuck your investors, but you're good.  
  
But, that wasn't going to be good enough. 0.6% tendered as a March 28th. Veritas knows they have a losing fight on their hands. People are using current numbers to value the company at $25-28, or even higher. Realistically, it would have probably taken at LEAST a $27 offer to make a second tender work. Snowball's chance in hell at $25, but not 0%. Veritas isn't dumb. They see the writing on the wall - they're looking at an absolute minimum of $25, and maybe as high as $28 to get this done. Or are they.....  
  
Over 80% (I think I heard as many as 88%) of investors were institutional. If you don't think these guys know each other you're delusional. Now, that's not to say they all are on the same page, something Engine Capital and a few others proved by coming out against it. But, Veritas had the phone numbers for all of them in their rolodex (that was an old plastic thing that held business-type cards for most of you here). Veritas gives some of the managers a call. ""We'll give you a bonus equal to X dollars per share if you sell."" Who knows where the X goes, but they know no one will REALLY call them out for tendering on a deal like this, and they DO love lambos, so......  
  
Let's say X is about 4. I think given the valuations, that makes sense. So these institutions and/or their managers are getting a bonus of $4/share times a bajillion shares. They're getting the $25 and they don't have to wait for it, and they don't have to give it to any of the people invested with the institution. Okay, sure, we'll sell.  
  
Veritas really only needed to secure 48-55% of the tenders in this manner. A few were already inexplicably in. So let's just say 50% to keep it clean. So they buy half the shares at $25, and half at $21, so they're cost averaging at $23. Even paying out ENORMOUS bonuses to the board and to institutions, they're still getting this stock at $4-7/share cheaper than it would have been if the tender failed. And don't get me wrong, there is another group like WallStreetBets out there. It's called ""Wall Street"". And they love their Lambos too, but when they get plays that can go to the moon its ACTUALLY a sure thing for them. So why the fuck not. Veritas under pricing got them a big bonus. Maybe an initial tender of $22-23 would have gotten a higher percentage, maybe even gotten the job done. But still getting it in at $23 plus a few extra bucks in misc bonuses is fine. Still way cheaper than the alternative, and they basically make money the second they take over, because the company is realistically worth more than they paid for it, plus they have another company this is a perfect complement for. Merge them together and it's even better.  
  
Now, I don't work for the SEC, but, I'm taking a stab this is a little on the.....illegal side. But really, who cares, right? Far from a sure thing the SEC finds out, and even if they DO find out, it's probably just a fine that averaged in STILL keeps the price under what it could have been. That's also assuming a couple of people weren't paid to look the other way. I don't think that's necessarily true, but I absolutely wouldn't put it past them.  
  
And this is why several law firms are already working on this one. They might lose a class action and STILL come out okay. This deal was THAT good for them."

Market makers watch this subreddit and adjust their algorithms, driving the price up, knowing that a bunch of ~~reta~~ traders from this subreddit are about to buy in.

If the options are up for the day more then makes sense for the movement, its too late to buy in, they will tank the next day.

Protip two: Before you ever get any option on the robber of hoods, add it to your options watch list, then view it on your options watch list, because guess what, now you can see the chart for that option and see how much its been pumped by wsb and market makers."

707,wallstreetbets,HMHC; Followed a retard’s advice and now here I am,10.0,tx88oa,2022-04-06T01:09:49Z,For clarification: the play is that hmhc is getting bought for 21 a share but that’s is very low. Institutions are not happy and will not tender this week forcing the buyer to offer higher. This takes place up until Wednesday 11:59 where the buyer has to get 51% of the shares to buy HMHC. On Thursday if the buyer hasn’t gotten the shares they have to bud higher putting the option itm and me getting paid. Search up HMHC on redit and u can find the retards I listened to for more info. Mainly I’m joking when I say my options are going to 0 cus institutions are not retards and won’t sell for 21 but probably  25 is a better estimate.

848,wallstreetbets,HMHC offer is so bad that law offices are already lining up the class action. $30 or bust.,1.0,txyqpd,2022-04-08T00:30:45Z,"Okay, this is theory, but I've been racking my brain all day trying to figure out in what universe this tenders at $21. It made no sense. Then I realized it made no sense IF everything was on the up-and-up.....  
  
So, the HMHC board unanimously votes for this using numbers that came in just before Q4 earnings and shows a much lower valuation. The board knew the Q4 numbers, they just chose to ignore them since they weren't public yet. The reason they used them, was because Veritas was paying them a HUGE bonus if this went through at $21. I mean, if I'm gonna get a fat 6-7 figure check as a bonus for this thing passing cheap, I'm prolly gonna try to pass it cheap. I mean, fuck your investors, but you're good.  
  
But, that wasn't going to be good enough. 0.6% tendered as a March 28th. Veritas knows they have a losing fight on their hands. People are using current numbers to value the company at $25-28, or even higher. Realistically, it would have probably taken at LEAST a $27 offer to make a second tender work. Snowball's chance in hell at $25, but not 0%. Veritas isn't dumb. They see the writing on the wall - they're looking at an absolute minimum of $25, and maybe as high as $28 to get this done. Or are they.....  
  
Over 80% (I think I heard as many as 88%) of investors were institutional. If you don't think these guys know each other you're delusional. Now, that's not to say they all are on the same page, something Engine Capital and a few others proved by coming out against it. But, Veritas had the phone numbers for all of them in their rolodex (that was an old plastic thing that held business-type cards for most of you here). Veritas gives some of the managers a call. ""We'll give you a bonus equal to X dollars per share if you sell."" Who knows where the X goes, but they know no one will REALLY call them out for tendering on a deal like this, and they DO love lambos, so......  
  
Let's say X is about 4. I think given the valuations, that makes sense. So these institutions and/or their managers are getting a bonus of $4/share times a bajillion shares. They're getting the $25 and they don't have to wait for it, and they don't have to give it to any of the people invested with the institution. Okay, sure, we'll sell.  
  
Veritas really only needed to secure 48-55% of the tenders in this manner. A few were already inexplicably in. So let's just say 50% to keep it clean. So they buy half the shares at $25, and half at $21, so they're cost averaging at $23. Even paying out ENORMOUS bonuses to the board and to institutions, they're still getting this stock at $4-7/share cheaper than it would have been if the tender failed. And don't get me wrong, there is another group like WallStreetBets out there. It's called ""Wall Street"". And they love their Lambos too, but when they get plays that can go to the moon its ACTUALLY a sure thing for them. So why the fuck not. Veritas under pricing got them a big bonus. Maybe an initial tender of $22-23 would have gotten a higher percentage, maybe even gotten the job done. But still getting it in at $23 plus a few extra bucks in misc bonuses is fine. Still way cheaper than the alternative, and they basically make money the second they take over, because the company is realistically worth more than they paid for it, plus they have another company this is a perfect complement for. Merge them together and it's even better.  
  
Now, I don't work for the SEC, but, I'm taking a stab this is a little on the.....illegal side. But really, who cares, right? Far from a sure thing the SEC finds out, and even if they DO find out, it's probably just a fine that averaged in STILL keeps the price under what it could have been. That's also assuming a couple of people weren't paid to look the other way. I don't think that's necessarily true, but I absolutely wouldn't put it past them.  
  
And this is why several law firms are already working on this one. They might lose a class action and STILL come out okay. This deal was THAT good for them."

870,wallstreetbets,A quick note as $HMHC's tender deadline approaches,17.0,twyinv,2022-04-05T17:37:15Z,"Here is the FUD you requested that I've found trying to use my own noodle. 
1. This could continue until August 22nd and technically if the company consents to it it could continue indefinitely based on this clause of the tender offer shown below

""more periods specified by the Offeror (not in excess of 10 Business Days each) but not (without the priorwritten consent of the Company) beyond August 22, 2022 (the “Outside Date”)""

This makes me think that Veritas has the right to continue extending the deadline up until August 22nd and past that point it would require consent from the company. Considering how badly they botched this sale I could see a world where they would drag this out until shareholders grow tired of the management team and decide to tender.

2. The fact that the stock is trading right at 21 indicates that the market strongly believes this deal is going to go through. The small breaks it experiences above 21 can most likely be attributed to the outrageous call volume leading to delta hedging. You can argue that the 0.6% tender number we received last week indicates that there is a low likelihood of the deal going through but it is absolutely crucial to notice that the stock did not drop on that news. You could interpret that two ways. One being that the market believes this stock is worth at least 21 but realistically is worth more. Or two that the deal still has a lot of time left in it and we don't know how the much larger shareholders actually feel. My gut says the former is most likely true but again I'm here to spread FUD.

3. There is a side to this story that we retail investors definitely don't have access to. The fact that the acquisition process was so flawed based on out of touch EBITDA information that management should have had a firmer grasp of considering the time of year the deal took place makes me extremely nervous that something is wrong at the management level in this company.

It’s been out there since February, and they can keep extending this agreement until august per the terms.   So why only request an additional week extension and not a month (or more)?

This makes me feel like they must be pretty close to >50% or confident they can get there within a week…

Thoughts?"

1020,wallstreetbets,HMHC bros on market open,1.0,ty4s0g,2022-04-08T00:28:06Z,"Okay, this is theory, but I've been racking my brain all day trying to figure out in what universe this tenders at $21. It made no sense. Then I realized it made no sense IF everything was on the up-and-up.....  
  
So, the HMHC board unanimously votes for this using numbers that came in just before Q4 earnings and shows a much lower valuation. The board knew the Q4 numbers, they just chose to ignore them since they weren't public yet. The reason they used them, was because Veritas was paying them a HUGE bonus if this went through at $21. I mean, if I'm gonna get a fat 6-7 figure check as a bonus for this thing passing cheap, I'm prolly gonna try to pass it cheap. I mean, fuck your investors, but you're good.  
  
But, that wasn't going to be good enough. 0.6% tendered as a March 28th. Veritas knows they have a losing fight on their hands. People are using current numbers to value the company at $25-28, or even higher. Realistically, it would have probably taken at LEAST a $27 offer to make a second tender work. Snowball's chance in hell at $25, but not 0%. Veritas isn't dumb. They see the writing on the wall - they're looking at an absolute minimum of $25, and maybe as high as $28 to get this done. Or are they.....  
  
Over 80% (I think I heard as many as 88%) of investors were institutional. If you don't think these guys know each other you're delusional. Now, that's not to say they all are on the same page, something Engine Capital and a few others proved by coming out against it. But, Veritas had the phone numbers for all of them in their rolodex (that was an old plastic thing that held business-type cards for most of you here). Veritas gives some of the managers a call. ""We'll give you a bonus equal to X dollars per share if you sell."" Who knows where the X goes, but they know no one will REALLY call them out for tendering on a deal like this, and they DO love lambos, so......  
  
Let's say X is about 4. I think given the valuations, that makes sense. So these institutions and/or their managers are getting a bonus of $4/share times a bajillion shares. They're getting the $25 and they don't have to wait for it, and they don't have to give it to any of the people invested with the institution. Okay, sure, we'll sell.  
  
Veritas really only needed to secure 48-55% of the tenders in this manner. A few were already inexplicably in. So let's just say 50% to keep it clean. So they buy half the shares at $25, and half at $21, so they're cost averaging at $23. Even paying out ENORMOUS bonuses to the board and to institutions, they're still getting this stock at $4-7/share cheaper than it would have been if the tender failed. And don't get me wrong, there is another group like WallStreetBets out there. It's called ""Wall Street"". And they love their Lambos too, but when they get plays that can go to the moon its ACTUALLY a sure thing for them. So why the fuck not. Veritas under pricing got them a big bonus. Maybe an initial tender of $22-23 would have gotten a higher percentage, maybe even gotten the job done. But still getting it in at $23 plus a few extra bucks in misc bonuses is fine. Still way cheaper than the alternative, and they basically make money the second they take over, because the company is realistically worth more than they paid for it, plus they have another company this is a perfect complement for. Merge them together and it's even better.  
  
Now, I don't work for the SEC, but, I'm taking a stab this is a little on the.....illegal side. But really, who cares, right? Far from a sure thing the SEC finds out, and even if they DO find out, it's probably just a fine that averaged in STILL keeps the price under what it could have been. That's also assuming a couple of people weren't paid to look the other way. I don't think that's necessarily true, but I absolutely wouldn't put it past them.  
  
And this is why several law firms are already working on this one. They might lose a class action and STILL come out okay. This deal was THAT good for them.  
  
But what do YOU think?"

Here’s hoping for a massive renegotiated price by Veritas 🍻"
1030,wallstreetbets,YOLO HMHC,6.0,tw2m7b,2022-04-04T21:18:08Z,"Why did you risk almost 2x the capital for Sept. 22.5c and not May? I'm holding the same amount of May strikes and if this gets extended again, I'll just roll into June, Sept, Jan 23, etc. for a little more capital... If they tender this week, then shit I'm out 6k but you're out 11.5k. 

Regardless, I got a feeling this will print some healthy returns for everyone - if I were Veritas, I would up my offer and still capture some fantastic returns on the company, and close this deal. Probably not gonna be $28, because why would they blow their whole load after the first negotiation, but closer to the 23-24 range. Everyone should stay realistic about the price targets. These VC's are stating price targets as if there was no buyout with price levels like 28, 30, 42, etc over the next 3 years. Remember shareholders are likely up 5-10x already after the last 2 years. That's a pretty safe and tasty offer for them to let Veritas buy out now instead of risking their already huge gains.

But what is my 2 cents worth.. I'm bullish on this deal still."

I truly believe if you are a retail investor, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  It's not that you will never have the opportunity to make this kinda return again, it's that you'll never be able to make this kind of return again on something that is as close to a sure thing as the stock market will EVER offer you.  


The only reason I have 520 is because I haven't been able to clear up enough capital to get more....yet."

1148,wallstreetbets,$HMHC - Houghton Mifflin - Give your roulette and blackjack money to Dwight,5.0,tt9gf1,2022-04-01T17:31:05Z,"One little nit-pick: institutional investors rarely tender before the deadline on the off chance some news comes out that would change their mind. They don't want to tender today and then hear about a better offer Monday and regret their decision.

So the fact that less than 1% have tendered doesn't mean much"

1155,wallstreetbets,$HMHC - Houghton Mifflin - Give your roulette and blackjack money to Dwight,1.0,tt9gf1,2022-04-01T23:33:51Z,This will stay pinned at $21. Institutional ownership is north of 80%. Overhead supply is low - meaning most institutions bought in below the acquisition price. They will cash out. Additionally even if it doesn’t go through - the price has ran up because of the news. It’s more likely to go down if the deal falls through than it is to go up. It’s not a good idea to commit serious capital to this. Your calls are going to zero.

I see why there would be a ceiling at $21 but how is that share price maintained?

In other words if some papa whale came in and bought a shit ton wouldn’t that break the ceiling and really fuk the tender price"

Sell 4/14 $22.5 C for $20-25. If sale is rejected and no counter is made, max loss is $100-$105 IF it falls. If it's raised to $23, you make $145-$150, and possibly get to make more if you can roll the 4/14 $22.5 to a 5/20 $22.5. If it's tendered you ""lose"" $0-$5, pending you can't roll one more time.

This link states they can essentially bypass proceedings if they’ve already established >50%+1 agreement.  They haven’t.  Otherwise this would be a done deal as of yesterday morning.  

You state numerous times on this thread that you ´believe’ they have various institutional agreements to account for >50%, which is great - but based on what, exactly?

If they did, why postpone?  If they did, then why have only <1% tendered?  

Essentially, your link is totally unrelated to your theory of institutional investors scheming to all of a sudden tender at the last minute.  

That being said, it’s still possible that a lot of calls get wrecked because nothing dictates that veritas would follow up immediately with a higher offer.  However, ~99% of shareholders stating they believe the stock is worth >$21 is a pretty bullish sentiment, which could move things short term.  

You also should keep in mind, this has gained a lot of interest of late.  It’s entirely possible that these institutions who you ´believe´have already conspired to tender, could just back out of those noncommittal (and illegal) agreements after seeing retail sentiment to push the offer higher."

1314,wallstreetbets,HMHC Shareholders that Did Not Tender,2.0,tyebmo,2022-04-07T20:47:19Z,Can we find out which institutions tendered their shares....I want to see which companies thought this was a great deal
1315,wallstreetbets,HMHC Shareholders that Did Not Tender,2.0,tyebmo,2022-04-07T20:53:19Z,"If anyone owning un-tendered shares gets automatically liquidated, please share an update here."
1316,wallstreetbets,HMHC Shareholders that Did Not Tender,2.0,tyebmo,2022-04-08T06:11:41Z,"If you didn’t tender, you just won’t get your $21/s until the deal is complete in a few months. That’s it."
1317,wallstreetbets,HMHC Shareholders that Did Not Tender,1.0,tyebmo,2022-04-07T14:48:44Z,"""Rejecting a Tender Offer

  
If you reject the tender offer or miss the deadline, you get nothing. You still have your 1,000 shares of Company ABC and can sell them to other investors in the broader stock market at whatever price happens to be available. In some cases, the people behind the initial tender offer will come back and make a secondary tender offer if they did not receive enough shares or want to acquire additional ownership in which case you might have another bite at the apple. However, as mentioned earlier, if you don't tender but enough people do, you're may be forced out of your ownership, anyway, as the enterprise is taken private down the road.""
