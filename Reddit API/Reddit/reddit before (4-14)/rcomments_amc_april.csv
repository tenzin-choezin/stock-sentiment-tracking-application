then instead of this Analysis, you can just ignore stock price and see who likes which stock

AMC usually moves in the same direction as GME but the % move is never the same. So over a certain time period, owning shares in one will make you more than the other.

However, if we assume both will go to say, $1k, percentage wise, you'd make more with AMC, period. Market cap doesn't matter because these spikes will only be temporary. Not like GME or AMC is going to be worth trillions and keep that price.

It's Comical,2.0,tf6vab,2022-03-16T13:06:10Z,"This is probably not something that they just jumped into and certainly did not do unadvised. I'm sure they paid very smart and people familiar with the industry before they made the brass balls move. So, they planned this and have had there finger on the button for awhile. 

So, what made them move? Could be that they found out Eric Sprott was buying a 20% stake as well. Could be that they are nervous about the Russia war. Could be that Canada locked individuals and Corps. out of the banking system for doing nothing more than having an opinion and peacefully doing something about it. Could be that Saudi Arabia is considering taking payment in the Yuan. The latter is my best guess.

So lets exercise our empathy and try to see it from AMC's prospective. Gold is stable. If the company is run by good management they even in chaotic times the price will maintain some value, but a gold/silver mining company will zoom higher of the fear trade. Having a 20% stack could give you the leverage to buy directly from the miner at spot or only slightly over. I wished I had a gold and silver mine. 

The bottom line is things are starting to really scary out there and when that happen people instinctively buy gold and silver. Crypto and stocks are just a mean to make gains in a broken cosino, but if you wana protect your gains, eliminate counter party risk, and make a mint in a turbulent time Gold/Silver is how you do that. 

Good luck you buncha F-ing Retards don't stay at the table too long."

He's one of the most successful pump and dump kings of all time.  

He's been pumping and dumping precious metals for decades, somehow ending up with billions for himself as all of his funds have cratered and died for the shareholders.  I could be mistaken, but I think he might be the richest person in Canada (?) yet his ventures themselves seem to always fail.

He's previously promoted theories that all the gold in Fort Knox and elsewhere is missing, and we're just a search warrant away from gold going to 10x.  Then he did the same with silver.  He started funds that crashed and got sold off for scrap.  In recent years he's been doing the same story with uranium.  It's the similar plot of the famous video game brick and mortar stock where it is supposed to blow up when the shorting cabal gets exposed.  

Hell, he might even be right about these commodity markets being rigged.  But that has never translated into anyone making big money except for him.

If he's in partnership with someone, crystal ball says Sprott will come away richer and the partner won't."

519,wallstreetbets,AMC to acquire 22% of Shiny Pet Rocks Minecrafter Hycroft in surprise move,2.0,temqer,2022-03-15T17:14:14Z,"So there weren't enough AMC bag holders lured into the offshore company ARQQ to make Adam and crew more money? So now AMC invests a gold mine that's priced so low it's tempting to buy-in but the only problem is that it rose $1 dollar from the surge and then dropped $1 from non-retailers selling. Now there are bag holders there as well.

Maybe AMC just wants their bag holders to cash out then reinvest in their goldmine ponzi so that they can keep making money off of ""apes"". 

***OR***

Maybe this is AMC's ""clean break"" that would lead to AMC's demise. It will be a clean break because they can just blame the goldmine and finicky retail investors selling off. Not all the insider trading and manipulation of their stock.

Keep in mind that AMC WANTED to be killed off since 2020 so that they all could get paid some of that relief fund. üòê"

Explain to me how even a 4 billion market cap makes sense. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned the insane amount of debt they‚Äôre in. 

Any squeeze possibility was killed with the float being diluted by hundreds of millions of shares.

937,wallstreetbets,AMC Earnings on May 5th. Opportunity for gains?,32.0,tzpjcg,2022-04-09T09:24:26Z,First time with meme stocks? Earnings is nothing but a bloodbath every time because heres a shocker these companies financials are terrible.  Wait till they buy the remnants of Theranos or something and  crazy eyes Holmes wears a rocket to the moon pin.
938,wallstreetbets,AMC Earnings on May 5th. Opportunity for gains?,24.0,tzpjcg,2022-04-09T09:24:00Z,The price always drops after AMC earnings call.  It doesn't matter if it's good news or not.
939,wallstreetbets,AMC Earnings on May 5th. Opportunity for gains?,4.0,tzpjcg,2022-04-09T14:38:56Z,It‚Äôs about to dip into the low teens next week. Might test the $11‚Äôs. Get shares and wait for a pop to sell tbe $30 calls for earnings. AMC will never sustain the $30‚Äôs because hedge funds are hedging it and making money on the ups and downs.

They were positioned to improve on the first big run, and they just didn‚Äôt. AMC is done for, Netflix is king"
943,wallstreetbets,AMC Earnings on May 5th. Opportunity for gains?,-3.0,tzpjcg,2022-04-09T11:03:04Z,"AMC is mired in billions of dollars of debt with no plan to pay it off and its current strategy was buying shares in a dying gold mine. If you're placing your gains in the hands of a sonic the hedgehog movie box-office returns I guess you're in the right place. If anything id buy puts on AMC, that's AMC ""Apes"" new strategy to drive the share price up (yes im serious)."

950,wallstreetbets,AMC Earnings on May 5th. Opportunity for gains?,1.0,tzpjcg,2022-04-10T01:06:47Z,"yeah because movie releases and ""foot traffic"" were what's been driving AMC pricing over the last 2 years.

On a less sarcastic note:

My feed had [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/maybemaybemaybe/comments/tzma71/maybe_maybe_maybe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) just above this post and I mistook it for being part of it... I thought it was pretty accurate until i realized my mistake.... wasn't as funny anymore."

I like many people bought AMC because we saw it was Shorted like GME but our money could buy many more shares of AMC than we'd get shares of GME.

You are a true r‚Äôtard to think that AMC is cheaper.  Price per share being lower doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs cheaper, it all about market cap.  Currently GameStop has a market cap of 6.53bil and AMC 7.91bil, so AMC is actually almost 20% more expensive, lmao.  I suggest you sell that worthless popcorn while you can and put it into a company that‚Äôs actually using their investors money wisely, like GameStop, and not investing in some random gold business that their buddy owns"
