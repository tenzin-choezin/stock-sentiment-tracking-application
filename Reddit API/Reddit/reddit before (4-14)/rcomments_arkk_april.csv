107,wallstreetbets,Mama Cathie says ARKK will $450 in 5 years,17.0,u2c4n1,2022-04-13T02:13:18Z,"The Magellan fund under Peter Lynch returned 29% annualized over 13 years. 

However, what Fidelity Investments found in their study was shocking.¬†***The average investor in the fund actually¬†lost money***. You read that correctly‚Ä¶ The average investor lost money in the Fidelity Magellan fund under Peter Lynch‚Äôs tenure during a period of time when the fund returned around 29% annually. This was also during the highest inflationary period in history 1977-1990.

Y'all are way too emotional and are frankly, losers. I mean that in strictly in the monetary sense, losers of tons of money because you're too emotional and schizo to just shut the fuck up and stop bitching and stay the course. Fucking ridiculous to turn over less than a year in a stock and start bitching about bag holding. 90% of you will never be rich from the stock market and you should just index invest. 

From Lynch himself:

>Hold on during rough markets: ‚ÄúThe key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.‚Äù

>Don‚Äôt try to time your investments, buy them on a regular schedule month after month (dollar cost average).

>Have conviction in the long-run and ignore doomsday predictions about the world coming to an end.

With that said, I respect Cathy and her conviction. I'm on the fence about ARK returning 50% annualized but I believe in innovation for sure. I certainly know shes going to outperform everyone commenting shit here, so probably most of you should just buy and you'll do better. Cathy and her fund buy what they know, just like Lynch. Difference is ARK hires people directly working in innovation, so they know about genomic sequencing and EV's instead of soda and insurance.

>We try and remind ourselves and our clients regularly that challenging markets are an opportunity. The chart of the Magellan fund isn‚Äôt a perfect chart. There was lots of volatility and long periods where the fund was flat or even down. The only real constant fact was that if you stuck with Lynch you made a shockingly high return."

I learned I'm not willing to sell when I'm up so might as well take a more consistent upwards trajectory at a slower pace that I'm content holding forever.

As you probably know QQQ tracks the NASDAQ 100; it's so tech heavy that it's essentially a tech index. VTI is a total (U.S.) market index and is therefore slightly more conservative than QQQ. I'm quite happy I invested in both and found them to be great choices for the long term for me."

Buy high and sell low is only a good idea if something fundamentally changed. Wood had some excellent calls, eg on Tesla.
I personally wouldn‚Äôt touch it for a few years. Invest in other businesses. If ARKK is down 75% or so look again whether you would put more into it, lowering your cost base.

It all depends on why you bought it. If you thought it was a solid portfolio and strong management then the drop is a gift from heaven."

463,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T04:12:16Z,"ARKK uses Wrights law to evaluate adoption and compliant performance.  This is an r way to forecast.  I think the price of the funds got hyped Way too much and the value of the portfolio reflected more the hype than the reality.  However, their stocks include many solid bets.  I‚Äôve invested in ARKK, lost, and I‚Äôm hanging on until the end.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll invest anymore, but I‚Äôm hopeful that the ARKK gamble, which was always high risk high reward, will pay off."
464,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T04:32:45Z,Have you tried buying companies stocks you personally believe instead of trusting an ETF?
465,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T10:15:08Z,"Cathie woods sucks and was a short term hype train. If you look at their portfolios, they are like a beginning investor trying to 10 bag to recoop losses at every turn while spending the train of money coming in."
466,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T10:45:33Z,"Yes, buy high and sell low."
467,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T14:14:44Z,"The fund has been knocked mainly because of our current rising rate environment. The 10 year is already at 2.75% and climbing. Once inflation is under control, ARKK will rebound. I would not sell it now. It's going to be a very volatile fund because it invests in newer, disruptive companies. You should never have bought it if you expected it to behave like an index tracking fund."
468,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T14:19:25Z,"Buy low sell high! 

Just hold on and forget about it. Put new principal into VTI and don‚Äôt fall into this classic trap of missing out"
469,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T14:23:37Z,Qqq is arkk but with actual legit companies that make money
470,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T14:31:49Z,"High risk funds like ARKK are supposed to be based on a high growth, but extremely high risk, long term strategy. It might not pan out either. It's generally a bad idea to keep more than 10% of your portfolio in *any* sort of this mega high risk stuff. I own some ARKK which I recently bought while it's down. I don't plan to sell it for at least 5 years, and it makes up a small percent of my total investments so if it does tank then it won't break me. I'm fully aware of the risks going in and that it *might* tank. I bought it though because I believe in 5 years it will have outperformed my investments into SPY. 

It's never the type of fund you should be investing a huge percentage of your portfolio into. Keeping 80% or more in SPY or VTI or whatever, and a small percent in crypto, high risk ETFs, or specific stocks, is a good strategy. Selling high risk assets when they tank, while not sticking to your original long term plan, is a terrible strategy. 

You should never buy high risk stuff like this without a timeline of when you will allow yourself to sell them. If you can't keep that discipline, then these type of assets just aren't for you."

472,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,1.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-11T16:46:54Z,"I have been in a similar spot. I personally would hold the AARK to a break even point or even a bit less if you can and then sell it. This depends how long you are willing to stomach losses. In the meantime, can you at least start your VTI? It will give you peace of mind just to get a very good diversified ETF started. Do want you want no advice here."
473,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,-3.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-10T19:02:06Z,"Hold your ARKK, and watch it go down another 50%. Then accept that loss."
474,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,-4.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-10T22:09:15Z,"Woods lost my respect when she predicted Bitcoin would go to $10 million. It will be lucky to ever see 50K again and cryptos in general are very unsound investments.  TSLA is also a very overvalued stock, like 300% overvalued.    I realize fads and young investors playing the gambling games are popular, but there aere so many blue chip stocks now for sale at very low or reasonable prices, and always remember, avoiding losses kis just as valuable as making gains.  So in this uncertain world, the last thing you should be doing it taking high-risk fliers. Elon Musk can afford to lose and play doggiedoo coin games, but you cannot."
475,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,-2.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-10T19:03:27Z,Or you could just buy puts on ARK. Seems like a safe bet
476,investing,Sell ARKK at a loss for VTI,-2.0,u0m4rk,2022-04-10T21:27:43Z,"Not saying do this.. but a 50% loss is a great time to double your position assuming you feel it's reached a bottom. Say you bought one share for $100 and the price dropped to $50. You buy another $100, giving you 3 shares total, a $66/share cost basis. At the current price of $50 you'd need the price to increase 100% to break even previously. Now you only need it to rise 32%.

The benefits are ideal at 50% loss, if the price keeps dropping then it gets harder.. ie if the price drops to $33 an additional $100 invested give you 4 shares total, a $50/share cost basis. You'd need the share to rise 51% to go from 33 to 50 however. If it drops to $25, an additional $100 brings your cost basis to $40/share. Shares would have to rise 60% to break even."

I am all for small cap innovation plays but when you invest in ARK they send you a daily email of their trades. It‚Äôs just nonsense. They‚Äôll literally sell stuff low and then turn around and buy it again high a few days later. It‚Äôs frustrating to watch. They seem even more impulsive than me.  

And they select such iffy companies that even with 1 or 2 big winners they get swamped out by 100 stocks that are at risk of going to zero."
