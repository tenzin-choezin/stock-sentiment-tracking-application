Fed pumps to keep Wall Street alive and avoid any crashes. Powell is a Wall Street puppet. He’ll let inflation run its course. If Powell wanted to address inflation, he would’ve ended QE last year.

As long as inflation is not insane, the effect on companies is not that big. 
In addition, the interest didnt rise much yet, so companies take in more money, but their borrowing costs are still low.."
