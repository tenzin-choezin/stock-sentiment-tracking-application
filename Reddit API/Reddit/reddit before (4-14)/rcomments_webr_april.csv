In the screenshot below, the Options price rose 650%(900% now) today, on an only 5-6% rise so far in stock price. Volatility is through the roof already (107%).

Meaning, before this post / today, the $12.5 Calls were virtually worthless. Meaning the probability they print was very, very low. The stock hasn't been above $12 in over 3 months. If you bought them before this, Congrats you're on your way to big profit, if you didn't and are considering buying them now, consider how IV works and that if this stalls at all on the way up your options will lose a lot of value. 

There's very little fundamental reasoning behind this company ""squeezing"". OP just thinks it will because investors think it's a shitty buy (40% shorted), and ""people like Grills"".
