45,wallstreetbets,NVDA in trouble by the end of the year?,3.0,twbk5s,2022-04-05T07:05:51Z,"New GPU prices will go near MSRP in the next few months!

The GPU-crypto mining frenzy is finally over. Here's a top list of reasons why:  
\- There is generally no real use for cryptocurrency (ethereum in particular) at the moment (except buying drugs and other illegal stuff) because transaction fees are too high and acceptability in the real world is non-existent.  
\- GPUs are not efficient compared to ASIC-Mining hardware because GPUs are primarily designed to run games. ASIC Mining equipment has much higher profitability. Ethereum is the exception and it is highly optimized for GPUs but still companies like innosilicon sell highly optimized ASIC-Miners for Ethereum. The lack of availability of Etherum ASIC-Miners is the only reason GPUs are still being used for Ethereum mining. The constant threat of changing Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake is only targeted at convincing people that the cost of investing in an efficient Ethereum ASIC-Miner is too big of a risk. ASIC miners are much more energy efficient compared to a mining rig with GPUs.  
\- Even when switching to PoS (Proof of Stake) in Summer 2022 it might not save Ethereum prices from continuing to fall. But as mentioned before this will probably not happen anyway because PoS only serves as a threat to prevent people from investing in ASIC mining equipment instead of GPUs.  
\- The video card manufacturers wanted to be part of and profit from the cryptocurrency frenzy and for this reason Ethereum was optimized to run efficiently on GPUs. The fork of Ethereum a few years back was needed to prevent GPU's with 4GB and lower to be obsolete for mining. The DAG (Direct acyclic graph) needs to be in VRAM and if it grows to over 8GB then all GPUs with 8GB or less would not be useable anymore.  
\- Finally everyone is facing the reality of cryptocurrencies meteoric rise in value is coming to an end and the risk in spending tens of thousands in hardware cost with months or even years before break even seems less attractive today.  
\- The only big advantage of GPU mining compared to ASICs has always been the argument that when the hardware becomes unprofitable or obsolete the GPUs could be sold on the market to recuperate costs. If my predictions are correct and the market will be flooded with GPUs in the coming months the price drop might be so huge that even this might be just a big lie invented by the hardware manufacturers to rip customers off. If GPU miners start to panic they might try to get out at any cost no matter how low the used GPU market falls.  
If there is anything to be learned from history then it's the fact that during the 1849 gold rush in California the mining equipment traders were the ones who made the most profit by providing overpriced tools that were much less worth when mining stopped.  
Let's hope everybody learns a lesson in the coming months so there will never be a GPU shortage with overpriced hardware again.  
The more the GPU market crashes the better for the gaming industry because only a crash in GPU prices will prevent people from investing in gaming hardware for GPU-crypto-mining again in the future. The more it hurts the GPU-crypto-miners the more they will think twice about the trade-offs between GPUs and ASICs.

  
TL;DR GPU sales might slow down because of decreased demand from miners in the coming months which might affect profits for nVidia and AMD. Prices for new GPUs might get close to MSRP in the coming months."

51,wallstreetbets,NVDA in trouble by the end of the year?,1.0,twbk5s,2022-04-05T02:11:53Z,So when ETH goes proof of state the mining community will dilute the pool of coins that can be mined. When this happens older less efficient GPU no longer make money due to the electricity cost. So anyone that wants to GPU mine will probably need a 3070 and up. All the new high end GPUs that get put on the market will get bought in seconds still by automated bots.

* Seemed innocent enough at first. Things were going okay, until suddenly they weren’t. You remember, you were there.   
  

* Doubled down, tripled down, quadrupled down, etc., ultimately ended up with 40 spreads open.   

* At one point I was even opening deep ITM spreads for $900 credit per $1000 risk… 90 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR, but obviously dismal odds of success.  

* Closed out my handful of other positions, some realizing losses, to keep funding and rolling twice. 
* My entire trading account is now one single position (rather, 40, so hello commissions and fees).   
  

* Monday March 14th – NVDA trades at \~213 and my spreads are facing max loss. My entire trading account is worth about $900, even dipping below $0 when the spread prices fluctuated.   

* In 4 days, my position either expires at max loss or I can keep throwing good money after bad by depositing more funds to keep rolling it. Despite the title of this post, I actually had given up and accepted that I had blown up my account. Thankfully I didn’t close out for the remaining pennies and decided to go down with the ship instead. Perhaps I just needed to hit rock bottom, because that was when things turned around.   

* Friday March 18th – ON THE MORNING OF EXPIRATION, NVDA continues its weekly rally and miraculously pulls above 260, bringing my spreads finally back OTM.   

* Anxious to get my ass out of the position and fearing that the initial morning pump might reverse, I closed out as soon as it passed 260, ultimately leaving $7K on the table (buying to close early) but just thankful to be alive and safe lest fate change its mind. Regardless, it is my largest single day gain of over $25K.   
  

* All in all: cashed out at $40K from an account basis of $14K, and now I can finally sleep at night. See y’all next week… maybe."

How likely is that, versus opening at 161 and then dropping to 153?

Still only just learning some of this stuff so what causes the gapped openings that we see, vs opening spikes?"

146,StockMarket,"Shoot holes in my GOOG, AMZN, NVDA play",1.0,trtjr6,2022-03-30T01:52:09Z,The only negative is you loose out on upside. At 15-20% your premiums are pretty small…well small compared to the investment. Since you have millions invested the actual cash value is good.
147,StockMarket,"Shoot holes in my GOOG, AMZN, NVDA play",1.0,trtjr6,2022-03-30T02:26:28Z,Solid plan.  I wouldn't limit it to 1 CC in total.  1 per 100 shares.  Just stagger them so you never have all of them exp on the same date.  Sell on big green days and always leave a couple close to exp and some un covered so you have a couple to sell when they are way up.  Buy back CC on down days.  I frequently set a trailing stoploss on my CC once they hit 50% profit at like 10 to 20% of the remaining value to account for volatility.

NVDA is the biggest part of my portfolio and I plan to keep it that way. AMD promising as well. I don’t see anything wrong with a tech heavy portfolio as tech is the future. Just continue to diversify over time - no need to sell and pay tax especially if you haven’t held for a year and will pay capital taxes.

If I’ve understood it right, he wants to buy into Apple but he’s already holding AMD and NVDA, and doesn’t want his portfolio to become too tech heavy, so he wants to know whether to drop and or nvda to replace the tech slot of his portfolio with apple"
162,stocks,Drop NVDA or AMD?,4.0,tybpmi,2022-04-08T03:01:39Z,"PE ratios are \~20 (AAPL), \~40 (AMD) and \~60 (NVDA). People will tell you AMD and NVDA are way overvalued. In a way they are, and certainly the PEs paint them as such, but if it were as simple as selling stocks above a certain PE and buying stocks below a certain PE we would all be rich.

Do your own research, but I like AMD's prospects the most out of the three. I think it's a matter of when, not if, Congress passes a big, fat stimulus package for chip makers like INTC and AMD. AMD's recent acquisition of Pensando makes them more competitive with Intel, which makes more than just CPUs. Intel also makes WiFi/Bluetooth modules, SSDs, I think a few other things, though I believe they gave up on the cellular modems. Dr. Su pulled off an outstanding recovery when AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy circa 2016 and I have confidence that she is choosing acquisitions very carefully and purposefully. 

Apple has slowing iPhone sales to contend with. Their M1 SoC is neato but I am selling my M1 MacBook and buying a Surface Pro 8. Still too many growing pains for more than YouTube and Office. A lot of software engineers/companies that hire software engineers are buying up the more expensive ($2-4k) MacBook Pros, but I think it's a little early to make the jump to ARM from x86. It's like electric cars... are they the future? Yes. Does that mean there's no demand for ICE cars? No. 

I think it's musical chairs for all three, and it's just about not being the one holding the bag when the music stops. That said, I think AMD has steam left.

You might look at Dell. It only has a PE of 4 but obviously AMD's good fortune is Dell's good fortune and vice-versa. Analysts can shit on it all they like, but I love their laptops, monitors and PowerEdge servers."

For a question of this specificity, I'd argue to hold all three and play the long game. 

Semiconductors will be used in many industries and appliances for years to come.

But if you really had to sell one, I'd pick AMD. However that's because I am personally closely following the competition between AMD and Intel and would throw the profits I made from AMD $12 to $150 into Intel as it is right now. 

Competition is wonderful and both Intel & AMD are key contenders in their fields when it comes to competition with some semblance of predictability to me.

Tl;dr; Hold onto your tech stocks. If anything, sell AMD and buy Intel now that the consumer perception for both companies have 'basically inverted'. Everyone claimed AMD would flop and reach the price it's at right now back in 2016/7. Now they're the ones screaming to buy AMD even though it's at a high as is. I could be wrong and it could go higher, but if you got in anywhere before 2021; you've made a profit either way."

They've consistently diluted your ownership by issuing shares over the past 2 years.  Apple on the other hand has increased your ownership of the company by 25% over the past 5 years due to share buy backs.  Personally I would wait for Apple to hit $150/share again before buying more, but I would consider dropping NVDA and AMD for Intel.  Intel has the profit that AMD and NVDA wish they had, has an average of 8% revenue growth YoY over the last 10 years, and has issued share buybacks during the process.  


However, if I had to pick between NVDA and AMD and which will net me a better return I would pick AMD.  The massive market cap of NVDA makes it hard for them to continue growing.  Also, AMD has initiated a share buyback program and is therefore beginning to offset the dilution that they caused over the past 2 years."

Eventually, it will even back out as the river slows back down. But imagine how much money you lose if you sell every time the herd moves sectors.

""They're interested in us using their foundries. We're very interested in exploring it,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said, according to a Reuters report.

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger confirmed that the company is in discussions with Nvidia. Intel expanded its business to accommodate chips designed by others near the beginning of 2021. The company calls its expanded offering ""Intel Foundry Services.""

Nvidia shares are also seeing strength after chip manufacturing executives urged Congress to pass legislation that includes subsidies for the semiconductor industry. The legislation would include $52 billion in incentives for chipmakers.

""Nvidia is seeking shareholder approval to double the number of authorized shares to 8 billion--a year after doubling the number of authorized shares to 4 billion and effecting a 4-for-1 stock split in the form of a dividend. The latest proposal would again require support from a majority of the shares outstanding. Abstentions and broker non-votes would be the same as a vote against, the company says.

Office and Cloud are the cash cows but it's insane how many pies they have their fingers in. They're also a leading platform for AI, developers, RPA/process automation, communication, cybersecurity, even fintech. No matter what happens in the business world in the next 5 years, they are well positioned to take the lead. Business spend also tends to be more steady in recessions than consumer spending. 

Google is also very solid and quite cheap, but have mostly failed to monetize their business outside of ads. They are vulnerable to a big earnings drop if consumer spending falls. Their business is much less diverse than Microsoft. They are also vulnerable to disruption through alternatives to web search, for example by Amazon, Tik Tok, Instagram or other discovery platforms. 

Nvidia is a clear technology leader but has had the biggest runup in valuation. Their business is in reality quite cyclical, but it's not currently being valued in accordance with that. Like Google they are quite vulnerable to falls in consumer spending or industrial manufacturing. It's a well-run company but over a ""short"" time horizon of 5 years I'm not sure they can guarantee high returns from their current point."

What NVIDA has going for it is that it it’s the furthest along in GPUs for deep learning/ML training, currently maintaining its lead through pushing more power/wattage with ridiculously huge cards/racks. Their GPUs are becoming less efficient, but they have to find ways to push the envelop with the diminishing returns from smaller lithography nodes. Thus far, NVIDIA GPUs are the engine of choice for training ML models and have even brushed off challengers like Graphcore. But it’s uncertain how long they’ll maintain that lead given the compute wall we’re facing. At that point, it’ll become a more commoditized play, and my guess is 10-15 years from now Chinese semiconductor challengers will rival NVDA in $/compute. NVDA sees this reality, and you can tell from their last GTC summit they’re looking to become more of a software services company to differentiate and maintain a locked in customer base as Microsoft, AWS have with cloud. 

I think there’s a chance NVDA could innovate into new segments, but they’ll have to go beyond consumer gaming GPUs, automotive, and data center HPC to remain on top when the performance gains shrink. I had money on NVDIA when the ARM acquisition was in play, and would bet more on ARM’s future (despite their current sales). They seem more chiefly focused in creating efficient designs, optimized ML a workloads; and semiconductor markets are heading that way. 

AI is for sure here to stay, but the future is more in which AI startups can create the world’s best domain-specific model. OpenAI, Google, MSFT, others have created these absurdly large pretrained models that are similarly encountering diminishing returns from brute-forcing more compute/data; but it’s a race to the bottom amongst big tech in licensing those models to other smaller companies fine-tuning the big models for specific applications. 

That said, just looking at the volume of AI papers and novel applications of SOTA models, my money would be on Google if we’re to expand the timeline to 10-15 years. NVIDIA for sure has a great future for the next 5, but I’m unsure about the next 10."

NVDA certainly has a bright future but things can change fast in the silicon world especially with more companies attempting to go in house following apples success. The stock has also been on a massive run and one that could see a lot of people take profit if a recession hits, also the most susceptible to reduced consumer spending IMO"

It has the issue where you constantly need to be doing R&D and improving the product just to stay in place. This creates a lot of risk because one bad generation can kill the stock price (see intel vs amd right now).

So NVDA would be out for me. Too risky for a concentrated bet, for the reason above.

Now between MSFT and GOOG, both are massive tech conglomerates. Both names are fantastic and have strong expected performance in my mind for the next 5 years. Both have a backbone of the company which is basically a monopoly on a consumer tech ecosystem (search vs windows/office).

MSFT Pros:

\- Bigger cloud presence

\- Bigger gaming presence

GOOG Pros:

\- YouTube

\- Lower multiple at 23 PE vs MSFT at 30 PE

I'd tip my hat to slightly to GOOG. It's cheaper and Youtube has no competition whereas MSFT is ahead in competitive spaces (cloud and gaming). Although if they had equal PE I would probably choose MSFT.

I'm also assuming none of the moonshots like Waymo or Hololens type projects would become relevant in the next 5 years. So I didn't factor those in, but moonshots could totally change the equation."

NVDA has gone down for 6 days in a row, and i only found ONE instance in the past 5 years where NVDA went red more than 6 days in a row.. it's just statistical probability IMO, even if we are going into a recession/bear market and NVDA keeps dropping, there's still going to be green days here and there, and there's a very high likelihood that tomorrow is going to be one of those days for NVDA, 7 red days in a row is extremely rare for this stock, that's not to say it's impossible, anything can happen, but i'll gladly take the risk cuz only one instance of that happening in the past 5 years, i like those odds

edit: just came back to point out that this ended up being a very successful trade, like i said it doesn't matter if we go into a bear market, stocks don't just go straight down without stopping, well not GOOD stocks anyway, and for every single day a stock goes red, the chances of it going green the following day increases, i use this same strategy to trade the indices too, if you see SPY or QQQ down 3-4 days in a row, chances are high that it will be green the following day, if you see them down 5-6 days in a row, it's almost guaranteed that they will be green the following day etc, that's simply how the markets work, regardless of what's happening or what news comes out, don't believe me just go through the charts yourself, there will ALWAYS be a counter trend move even if it only lasts a day"

ASML seems like the safest of them all to me. It's based on Europe so it has little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly. Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.

I like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.

NVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term."

Takes about 2-4 years just to build capacity. But the TAM just keeps growing.

Even UMC, TXN, Global foundries making older nodes have max capacity and selling out.

But if I had to pick 5.

My picks are QCOM, NVDA, MRVL, AMD and INTC.

TSMC should be higher liken$150+. But geopolitical risk just doesn't let it go up. So I don't have it.

Samsung would work too. But can't really buy it stateside."

I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.  
  
I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it."

409,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,14.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T10:15:35Z,I bought Nvda at 306 haha
410,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,48.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T00:38:02Z,Unless it never hits 180.
411,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,8.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T01:54:14Z,Sounds like a plan. Except when it never hits $180. Market doesn’t have to be logical and for the projected growth NVDA has and consistent revenue beats you’ll never see NVDA sitting at a 9 or 20 PE
412,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,14.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T00:40:07Z,Would be surprising to see it drop that low. Next major support is at $200. Not sure if it’ll drop that low but that’s what I’m eyeing as an entry point
413,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,3.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T03:22:53Z,OP must hold put
414,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,2.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T02:54:28Z,I strongly doubt that it will get down to $180. I think it would have a lot of buyers at $200 that would prevent it from going lower than that.
415,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,2.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T02:54:56Z,"I sold a bunch of 180 puts. Doubt I’ll be assigned. Also sold amd 85’s. I want to go long both these stocks. Just went long on amzn and goog a month ago at the dips. What do you guys like better, amd or nvda?"
416,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,4.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T02:45:49Z,"You may waIt to $30.00 to purchase back, because its going down to 30."
417,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,2.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T01:56:05Z,Why would it ever fall that far ?
418,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T02:10:13Z,Yah I won't buy AAPL till $140 either. 🤡
419,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T00:48:19Z,"I would say no. I’m not selling mine. But you have the right reason to sell, that being their valuation has run up. So the question you have to ask yourself is what standard to use to sell out when a stock valuation outpaces their growth and gets a little hot. How much is too much?"
420,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T01:22:53Z,I sold all recently at around 265 on the way up. Initially abit gutted since it just kept going up. Obviously glad now especially with this massive dilution crap around the corner
421,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T07:15:50Z,Just buy more if it gets that low.
422,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T11:43:24Z,It’s not going to $180. $215 is as low as I would wait for it to go.
423,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T16:50:38Z,Yes the plan is to sell at the top and buy at the bottom
424,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,1.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T18:29:33Z,"Coming from a scientific and high computing background, I would vote nvdia as a very big buy. High performance cloud computing is still a very very early market with almost no players among the big cloud guys. Nvida is positions the self as a cloud gpu provider for almost all resource intensive tasks including things from months of machine learning jobs to that of pharmaceutical simulation. With their current interest in quantum computing simulators as well, I think they are really positioned for long term (5+ years) market."

426,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,-8.0,u0uymd,2022-04-11T01:23:53Z,I am looking to buy back in at the exact same number! Will DCA from there. Could easily see 120-150 range. Doing 180 for the massive cult following it has.
427,stocks,NVDA - Take profits and buy back at 180,0.0,u0uymd,2022-04-12T05:39:35Z,Don't fall for this fake post. This is astroturf fud.

In leading nodes it's winner take all. Samsung might be the first to GAAFET, but it doesn't seem their node is actually better than FINFET by TSMC anyway.

Over the coming years, TSMC will increase the capacity for leading nodes to the point that they can supply $AMD with enough wafers. When that happens, there is a lot you can do with the increased supply of leading nodes, like a console mid-generation refresh, Steam Deck 2, etc. things that so far are not announced

But maybe $ASML is not able to deliver all of the machines everyone needs"
