They announced a dividend too, thats even more bullish id imagine?"

8,stocks,"$TSM Q1 Earnings: Net Profit up 46%, Revenue up 36%, Strong Guidance on Chip Demand",10.0,u3bmm7,2022-04-14T07:28:50Z,"Semiconductor market has been highly uncertain lately, might this give it a healthy boost across the board? Very very surprising report imo.

(I don't own $TSM directly, but through $SMH)"
9,stocks,"$TSM Q1 Earnings: Net Profit up 46%, Revenue up 36%, Strong Guidance on Chip Demand",7.0,u3bmm7,2022-04-14T08:04:33Z,"So those Barclays analysts were spouting bullshit about declining demand? I usually mock the 'manipulation' spam in the discussion thread, but just for once.... I'd like to play the role and say, ""Ah, the typical manipulation--I mean, 'volatility' from the big boiz.""

At least it took AMD sub-100 so I can lower my cost basis."

It has been doom and gloom nonstop for semis for most of the year. Hopefully this shows strong earnings + guidance are ahead for the industry, as tsmc is upstream of the major semicon players like Nvidia, Amd etc."
