There are really solid/bullish lockup provisions on this company and add in the fact that there was no dump at S1 Effect, means early investors are very bullish on the company.

Also, go back and look at the option flow for ARQQ over the past few months, along with the available shares to borrow plus CTB fee. See all those ITM floor trades? Those are shorts or folks that have opened unhedged positions trying to stay above water. Why? Because the insiders decided to re-negotiate their lockup after the initial agreement to be more long term and in other words, bullish. Shorts and folks who thought selling naked OTM calls found themselves on a bad spot, but lucky for them, no one was really paying attention. They went from expecting your standard despac dump to realizing it was never coming. 

Tomorrow could be fun but maybe next week. All I know is lol at the folks saying ARQQ is done."

191,wallstreetbets,"$ARQQ, Ultimate Gamma Squeeze with MASSIVE OI and NO VOLUME, inspired by $EVTL!",3.0,u2r8uu,2022-04-13T16:28:48Z,"Finviz says there are 14M shares float.   


Looking at all options open interest as of yesterday: [https://options.hardyrekshin.com/#ARQQ](https://options.hardyrekshin.com/#ARQQ)  


The pivot point for a gamma ramp is around $14.94. That's the price where gamma is the highest using yesterday's open interest. It'll probably be slightly lower with all the April 14 15C buying that's gone on.   


Using just the April 14 15C open interest of 6984. There is a potential obligation to buy 698,400 shares if they go ITM.   


This represents 5% of outstanding shares. Not much in the world of gamma squeezes.  


Gamma squeezes tend to require a larger proportion. That's what the redemption caused for this stock back in September when the original business deal was voted on."
