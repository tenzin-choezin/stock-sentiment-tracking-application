Margin.

My QQQ plays were fucking stupid. They were butterfly’s that were far out of the money.

I bet very deep.

SPY is fucking me but will help me if it drops. It was a good play (it was up $800 at a time). For me to go green SPY needs to drop $40. I don’t want to wish loss for others but fuck others.

Currently riding 2/3 my portfolio in SQQQ shares that up 5%, only stock I hold on this list is a small F position that I can hold through a bleed down and definitely want to add to if it hits the 13s. Will definitely pick up some $15-18 LEAPS at that level as well

Also thoughts on if PPI tomorrow morning could start a major sell off?"

F is my favorite stock, but I jumped out when it looked like it was going to give up the $20s.  Been riding some 05/06 puts so I have the option to hold through their next earnings before expiry.  Do you think it will break support before then?  I don’t expect the market to react well to their EC after this constrained quarter.  I might sell some puts that week with the hope of getting assigned and start rebuilding my position, just hope that’s not too soon to start moving back in"

I’m quite a bit less bearish than this sub is on the whole, but I think you have something about the following two days.

86,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",4.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T02:57:57Z,Caught that run up today for a 70% gain.  VIx was in a clear downtrend. And had just formed a bear flag. But SPY was red for 2 more candles even as VIX was getting ready to drop. Bought a call there and watched it go positive and never look back
87,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",4.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T02:52:49Z,Hindsight is 20/20
88,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",2.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T04:35:42Z,Thanks for TA!!! Lots of consolidating. Big move coming up. Hard to know if it will be to the upside or downside but for 3 weeks SPY has stay in range bouncing up and down resistances.
89,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",2.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T04:45:06Z,There has been sector rotation towards healthcare and consumer staples 😂. Seems like we’re heading towards end of the bull cycle. Hopefully earnings can lift big tech up
90,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",2.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T04:54:26Z,I have a 59 TQQQ call that was beautiful like 2 weeks ago. But that was 2 weeks ago...

95,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",1.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T02:15:04Z,Does VIX and SPY react in opposite directions and does one react sooner than the other?

181,wallstreetbets,"I was down 12k yesterday, now up 40 grand. SQQQ",2.0,twz95y,2022-04-05T22:40:29Z,Seems to be an ongoing debate about options and SQQQ/QQQ. From the numbers I’ve crunched they’re about the same. But starts to tilt one way or another the longer you hold. Any reason you play SQQQ? I play both regularly. Just curious to hear what others think.

So far it is only 50% from ATH. Not good enough. I would start considering only after it is about 80%-85% from all time high .

I understand you're wanting to lump them into categories for the sake of your argument but the problem is they're far from just a car company. 

I'm not going to get into an argument on Reddit about Tesla because it becomes political but I'll just say Tesla's mission has shifted from just car manufacturing to AI and obviously mass energy storage with the goal of replacing centralized utilities. 

Ironically if Tesla was just a car company it wouldn't be valued at $1 trillion market cap and almost 5% QQQ. To drive my point home, why would ARK have Tesla as it's largest holding if it's just a car company? 

Given the purpose of your post and the market cap I think this should be reconsidered."

Shit happens. In my case the Great Recession and COVID really fucked up our finances.

I couldn't find rewarding work during the Recession for several years, so I went into debt. Nobody was hiring fresh college grads so I had to work in a call center and it didn't pay the bills.

During the COVID crisis the employer I was with at the time cut our salaries 20%.

I also had a son with chronic health issues which wasn't cheap for quite some time.

I'm doing fine now, as I found a better job. I'm able to put in as much in one year as I could in the last 10, but anyway the point is shit happens. Life is random and unfair and it's not always a person's fault they didn't have an investment account by the time they're in their late 20s.
