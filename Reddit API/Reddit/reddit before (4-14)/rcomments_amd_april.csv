7,wallstreetbets,Cramer is bullish on AMD. How fuk’ed are my calls?,24.0,tvnxhc,2022-04-04T01:13:28Z,"I think that was a short term narrative if you will. I track and day trade AMD and it’s been bouncing between $102 to $125 for awhile. ACCUMULATION 
I wouldn’t been surprised to see you calls near or in the money over the next few weeks or months. They’re LEAPS, well done. Weeklies, you’re toast. The overall market is probably going to rally into a blow off top into the fall. Look I’m bearish on the condition of the markets but they are showing bullish trends as of now. I believe the crash / correction everyone is looking and calling for is probably being delayed into fall this year or EOY. If AMD closes below $100 then my idea is invalid, this stock is great for day / swing trading. Lots of volatility and massive tute interest. And it’s a good company, I believe chips will be in 2022 what vaccines where in 2021."

I feel like the safer play would be to sell these things the day before earnings and profit from the high IV if you're right. At that point you'd likely be in the green if AMD moves up and waiting until after expiration would probably not be necessary. I hope you do well.

276,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,26.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T01:58:05Z,I bought calls today on the dip. I think under 99.3 we will be seeing 95-88. I also think everyone is aware of the support at 100 so everyone has their stop loss right below 100. If it breaks that I think we will see a huge dip very fast with all the stop losses getting triggered.
277,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,20.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T10:07:24Z,This is none sense.  The stonk is going to $1000 a share. I know because I had a dream back in 2018 and it told me to buy 10 shares of Amd at $10 buckaroos and then to hodl hodl hodl.  So for past 4 years I have been hodling and will only sell once it reaches $1000 a share as it was foretold in my dream.
278,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,10.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T02:14:50Z,Bought calls today that expire next Friday. Am I fucked?

284,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,3.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T02:25:49Z,I have been watching that as well.  $100 is an interesting spot I might play some calls on Monday as well depending on how futures look on Sunday evening.

286,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,2.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T06:20:20Z,Only exception here is crash of 2022
287,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,2.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T10:08:31Z,"AMD has indeed bounced off around $100 level multiple times, but what appears a little odd to me is that considering the current price level being at a relatively high point, the volume over the past 10 weeks (starting week of Jan 24) has been consistently higher by roughly half of the volume before Jan 24... as if people have been selling positions throughout the oscillation pattern over the past 10 weeks.

My personal stance is that price could bounce up a little next week, meet the resistance around $105, and possibly come back down later. If it does not hold onto the $100 support, I'm more inclined towards the bearish side in the mid/long term....

288,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,3.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T04:55:18Z,"This might be one of the worst and most superficial ""DDs"" I've ever read. The technical analysis is weak as fuck. Your first pic has a few horizontal lines and nothing else...  Your second pic doesn't show the ATH / start of the downtrend. But worse than that, you are ignoring literally every macro issue that helped support the price rise over the past few years and how almost every single one of them are likely to be working in the opposite direction. 

The semis as a class are having huge supply chain issues. Crypto-mining for chains like ethereum, which helped boost the sector and make normal graphics cards impossible to find, are switching to proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work, which means you can do it without some high end high margin equipment. It also means a shit ton of second-hand expensive video cards are going to flood the market over the next year, depressing sales. 

Interest rate increases will soon let some bonds start providing real competition to S&P dividend yields, and ""growth"" stocks don't even pay dividends so they'd get clobbered even more. The only bright side here is that AMD's PE isn't 100+.... but I'm not sure that'll help much because there's real evidence of demand destruction. If demand drops 20%, the ""E"" part of P/E could go down 30 or 40%. If the market to cut the ratio as well from 40-ish to 30-ish, you could see a 50% draw down from here. 

I'm not saying it'll happen. I'm saying your DD is weak. Using only TA (and especially weak weak TA) is dangerous in times like this."

292,wallstreetbets,Will AMD hold $100? My analysis,2.0,tzit8e,2022-04-09T14:58:46Z,"AMD is dumping with high volume and has clearly gapped under the 1D 200 MA from the analyst downgrade. In comparison, other stocks such as TSLA and AAPL have not clearly gapped under the 1D 200 MA, and made it back quickly. TSM is headed for the 1W 200 EMA at $83.61 because it reversed a bull flag, which brings other chip stocks down. AMD has a support of $72.32 at the 1W 200 EMA."

How likely is that, versus opening at 161 and then dropping to 153?

Still only just learning some of this stuff so what causes the gapped openings that we see, vs opening spikes?"

Semiconductor demand is about to explode. As Ford, Chrysler, and GM start getting into the electric car and self driving car business they'll need upwards of 2-4x the amount of semiconductors per car.

I'm also pretty bullish on the long-term potential, I think the overall market correction has been pretty rough for most tech (see: NVDA). I bought 115c for 4/29, as I'm expecting some pretty serious action around earnings. Although every time a company has good earnings the stock price seems to drill for some reason. I'm hoping for a big run-up to earnings the following Monday and I'm probably gonna liquidate my full position (if I'm ahead at least) during the run up, and wait until the inevitable tank after earnings to buy back in."

438,wallstreetbets,AMD Near Support at $100. Swing Trade Possibly? 2-3 Month Timeline,12.0,txv76r,2022-04-06T20:22:46Z,I've been waiting for the sub 100$ drop to start a position. Willing to hold bags and average down with this one.
439,wallstreetbets,AMD Near Support at $100. Swing Trade Possibly? 2-3 Month Timeline,7.0,txv76r,2022-04-06T20:29:13Z,If that 100 support breaks it could go back into 80’s with current market conditions. It’s bounced off 100 several times so we’ll see. Most likely tomorrow..

441,wallstreetbets,AMD Near Support at $100. Swing Trade Possibly? 2-3 Month Timeline,5.0,txv76r,2022-04-07T04:49:24Z,"FYI, AMD authorized an [$8b stock buyback](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1050/amd-announces-new-8-billion-share-repurchase-authorization) a little over a month ago.

As for potential catalysts there is a thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\_Stock/comments/ruhzms/catalyst\_timeline\_2022\_h1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/ruhzms/catalyst_timeline_2022_h1/)

When it comes to stock movements, aside from AMD's own earnings and uncontrollable macro events I'd say the biggest mover of AMD stock is INTC earnings.  NVDA to a lesser extent.  AMD and INTC seem to be inversely correlated quite often during earnings, while AMD and NVDA usually have good correlation.  New product launches have little to no effect on the stock price, and if there is movement it only lasts intraday."

Long 350 shares at an average price of $100.55 and holding over the weekend.  Jumped the gun a little on this one I think but I couldn't help myself.  Have 100 shares to get rid of before 8:00PM tonight but holding the other 250 to see what we do Monday.  Looks like I'll set my alarm for 4:00AM on Monday just in case there is a selloff.  Otherwise I think we should look good for the upcoming week.  As a reminder, the market is closed on 4/15 so we have a 4 day trading week next week.  I'll keep you all posted."

I got a bullish position on AMD as well for May; but I used a zebra; so a lot easier to hold through a small dip like this.

If you are not comfortable with the loss you see now… then perhaps getting out and rethinking your trade might be worth it.  You got the weekend to think about it; or get a new fish to consult."

483,wallstreetbets,amd TA: Triple bottoms reversal?,6.0,typmjq,2022-04-08T01:51:14Z,"I’ve been analyzing this price structure a lot today. My final conclusion is a violent breakout to new ATH by end of May early June. I’m buying 4/29 $115 calls for earnings and June $125 calls for anticipation of new ATH by then. These two structures from August and November look identical except the Oct-Nov run is much larger overall. I believe the next rally structure will be the same but larger again. This is algo run and it’s clearly in accumulation mode right now; distribution will follow.
Edit- the move from Oct-Nov high took two full months so a rally to new ATH may be longer this time around. Still I’m anticipating new ATH this year at some point."
484,wallstreetbets,amd TA: Triple bottoms reversal?,5.0,typmjq,2022-04-08T02:29:50Z,"Honestly, I really like this play and I’ll be watching it closely. The $100 mark on AMD is an absolutely massive  support level. 108-112 seems to be the resistance point to really head back up. I’ll wait to see which breaks first and I’ll place my bets accordingly. NVDA is def in a similar situation. Overall I’m bullish on the sector but we could 100% see more pain."

Not AAPL or MSFT, but well represented.

If the market rebounds from here, AMD should end up going with it."

No it is not. Also, pretty sure you mean additive.

***Adaptive means that the system is able to measure and adapt its process in real-time***

Do you own a 3D printer?

Do you work in manufacturing?

Do you know how many parts I can cast, forge, stamp, mold and machine in the time it take to 3D print one part?

It is good for one off, prototype and very low volume unique applications. The technology is still way too slow. It can't replace any of the above processes I mentioned.

I own and utilize a 3D printer, and it is not shitty plastic. We print gages and prototype parts. To print a 1.25"" diameter piston that was 2.5"" tall took 4 hours just last week. Methods Machine tool was selling Markforged and ended up dropping them because there was no money in it.

Their liabilities equal their assets so they basically have nothing on NET. The cashflow has no history so you're buying the growth. It's dependent on new product release cycles sure but most crucially dependent just on whether or not this tech takes off. Looks promising to me but idk what I'm talking about and also casting metal objects or CNCing isn't a shabby alternative. I think this is a multi-year play and a hard way to make easy money.

Actually AMD has completed the acquisition on 14th Feb 2022

[https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2022-02-14-amd-completes-acquisition-xilinx](https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2022-02-14-amd-completes-acquisition-xilinx)

SANTA CLARA, Calif. 02/14/2022

AMD (NASDAQ: AMD) today announced the completion of its acquisition of Xilinx in an all-stock transaction. The acquisition, originally announced on October 27, 2020, creates the industry’s high-performance and adaptive computing leader with significantly expanded scale and the strongest portfolio of leadership computing, graphics and adaptive SoC products. AMD expects the acquisition to be accretive to non-GAAP margins, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow generation in the first year.

at the botton of announcement:

""Upon close, Xilinx stockholders received 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock. Xilinx common stock will no longer be listed for trading on the NASDAQ stock market.""

Their GPUs debut is lack luster it seems and will take some more time to bring them into a competitive spot.

Also with the Xilinix deal going through AMD has massive room for growth and processor fusion.

0% chance gaming goes full cloud before the next generation of consoles come out.

Edit: If you want a simple thesis for this, look no further than Elden Ring. It will be at least 5-6 years (god knows how long really) from now before you could experience that game at its fullest through cloud (no latency, all graphics and performance running identical to playing on a series x/ps5).

Let's not forget as well that in that time, the graphical and performance standards will increase as well. Gamers will not go backwards in graphics/performance just to play something on cloud. Gamers will seek out the OPTIMAL way to play something with the best performance. I would think peak performance may always be on a physical console or pc, or at least there will always be a market for it.  Cloud may get better, but running it on your own machine will always have more potential IMO."

Even if ARM does become the next 'big' thing, it's still going to take a long time for the industry to transition. After all it's not exactly cheap, quick or easy to replace entire servers just like that, not to mention hardware compatibility with everything else. And although ARM has come along way, it's still miles away in terms of computing power from x86, so even if Microsoft manages to create 1:1 compatibility without any bugs or issues (which in itself is pretty impressive) it's going to be quite some time before we start seeing ARM-based gaming laptops. As you said even that's on Windows 11 which again will take a long time for companies to transition to (especially with how horrible it is), so it's best use-case would be things like Chromebooks & work-laptos e.g. Word, Excel, and web browsing (especially due to power consumption), and possibly light gaming.

We have all seen this before. Range bound for 1-2 years, so that the big boys can take advantage of the action. Until  we come to the point that evidence for company's growth is so overwhelming so that the MM has no choice but to let it rocket, probably again to their advantage. Then, it might be range bound again. Ad nauseum.

If you are not convinced, come up with AMD's projected PE ratio (you haven't even mentioned XLNX once lol) and current PEG ratio -- and compare them to its peers. If anything, it's being heavily underpriced right now.

In any case, to time the post so that it coincides with a recent price plummet (which many believe to be a flagrant manipulation) feels like a real cheap shot, instead of a legitimate bear case."

So unless tv manufactures start making sets powerful enough for multiplayer games like warzone or gta online to be played on than consoles still have to stay around.

Huh as I was writing this I realized that they might actually just do that once the two markets fully detach. Because when you think about it a smart tv is just a really big smartphone with barebones software so once tv hardware gets to the point where it can run multiplayer games than all Microsoft has to do is spread the xbox's os to every tv manufactures in the same way that google spread android across smartphones and kick amazon/google/apple out of the smart tv market unless one of them buys Sony out.

1.	The efficiency advantage of Apple processor is more of the result of TSMC N5 node and the extremely capable design team of Apple than the ARM architecture. ARM doesn't have much efficiency advantage over x86 in HPC application in the same node and design of similar competence. The design is more important than the ISA.
2.	Designing a processor is extremely expensive, and the cost is rapidly increasing with each new node due to increased complexity. It would cost hundreds of millions, even billions to design a chip in N4 or more advanced node. Not many companies can afford that. Below a certain volume, it's more cost effective to buy chips from Intel or AMD than to fab your own chip with in-house ARM design, and that volume is getting larger.
3.	Building a competent chip design team takes a lot of time and money. A good processor design is built upon years of technical legacy. Apple started design their own ARM-based architecture with the A5 in iPhone 4S. It takes them more than 10 years to become capable of making the M1 series. The design team at ARM is much less capable than the team at Apple and AMD. If Amazon or Microsoft want to design their own ARM-based architecture, it would takes them years to catch up with Apple. Before that, AMD would still be the better option. The only one have the potential to catch up with Apple in efficiency is Nuvia(Qualcomm), but they have nowhere near the budget of Apple and AMD.

TL;DR: Processor will rely on economic of scale more in the future due to rapidly increasing design cost in advanced node, and it's easier to achieve economic of scale as a processor vendor that sells to many customers like AMD."

Also Alder Lake is huge?  For what, consumer desktop?  For how long, AM5 will be out this year.  With no big improvement on efficiency, Intel is still dead in the water in Data Center.

Instinct and RDNA 2 are proving that AMD can be competitive in the GPU space, but work still needs to be done, I expect you'll see great things this fall from RDNA 3, where Nvidia is resorting to insane power draw to get where AMD is going.

Gaming moves to the cloud... Stadia DOA

Can AMD win gaming cloud?  They own the SoC for Gaming via PS and Xbox.  But we are still a long way from this being the norm, especially in Europe and NA.  Latency will always be an issue.

Consoles are dead... Which is why this gen is growing faster than ever.


Mobile gaming is bigger.  Yeah which is why AMD partnered with Samsung.

AMD has the best scaling core in the world period. And it's just about to get even better with zen4.

ARM is not displacing x86. Not by a long shot. And if you need proof. Just look at how expensive and under whelming Apples M1 Ultra is. For heavy workloads nothing beats the Zen core.

$6000 M1 Ultra is slower than a 3950x which costs a fraction and which has been around for years now.

Microsoft has been making ARM laptops for a long time now but they don't really sell.

AMD is not going anywhere, consoles are not going anywhere, and this is one of the most absurd post I've ever read."

Its still wayss away from being real but should allow Intel to become TSMC while being fully based in US and is backed by the federal and state government. Is the world going to have to transition to ARM at this point because x86 efficiencies dont seem like theyll be able to keep up due to fundamental architecture differences?

Would love to have a chat with you about a few things:

- Do you think Apple would ever/could ever enter the B2B market by making server chips? You mention whenever makes the best ARM chip wins cloud and I agree. Right now that is Apple.

- How bullish are you on Qualcomm? I agree that their experience could make them a major player in delivering ARM chips to the PC/Windows World... But I feel like their core business in being that for smartphones is threatened by all the major players going custom: Apple is already there, Samsung too, now Google and I except Xiaomi and BKK will too."

Curious that TSM at current valuation (~18 times FY22 earnings, with ~28% rev and ~37% eps growth in FY22) is just ""ok"", given that AMD, APPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT, NVDA, BABA ,... now even INTC (partially) all depend on third party foundries to make their new and existing high performance chips. Hence I got the follow questions and would appreciate your perspectives:

a.  How much competition TSM faces from Samsung currently, and how fast can 
    INTC/GFN catch up with TSM/Samsung? 

b.  What's the capacity picture at TSM vs existing/pending foundry capacity 
    from Samsung/INTC/GFN in latest nodes?

c.  how much geopolitical instability factored into your view on TSM, or is 
    it largely based on pure competitive dynamics?

d.  It had been suggested that semi foundry capacity onshoring does not 
    really impact TSM in the short term. What's your view on that?

e.  Are there any listed firms specialized in manufacturing high 
    performance ARM's chips?

thanks very much!"

And most importantly, Mark Papermaster actually spent 2009-2010 at Apple!! 2010 is when the M1 chip was started. So he must have known Apple’s vision from the beginning, listening from the man Jobs himself. And Papermaster is specialized in server business all the way back at IBM. 

I would say your points are very valid and AMD might indeed lose big customer like Apple, Amazon. But I am 100% certain AMD is fully aware of all these potential issues for a very long time. At this point, my bet is on AMD’s strong leadership teams, Lisa Su, Mark Papermaster, Victor Peng etc.. and believe they will navigate through the industry and find the best business solution.

In a way they are, and certainly the PEs paint them as such, but if it were as simple as selling stocks above a certain PE and buying stocks below a certain PE we would all be rich.

Do your own research, but I like AMD's prospects the most out of the three. I think it's a matter of when, not if, Congress passes a big, fat stimulus package for chip makers like INTC and AMD. AMD's recent acquisition of Pensando makes them more competitive with Intel, which makes more than just CPUs. Intel also makes WiFi/Bluetooth modules, SSDs, I think a few other things, though I believe they gave up on the cellular modems. Dr. Su pulled off an outstanding recovery when AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy circa 2016 and I have confidence that she is choosing acquisitions very carefully and purposefully. 

Apple has slowing iPhone sales to contend with. Their M1 SoC is neato but I am selling my M1 MacBook and buying a Surface Pro 8. Still too many growing pains for more than YouTube and Office. A lot of software engineers/companies that hire software engineers are buying up the more expensive ($2-4k) MacBook Pros, but I think it's a little early to make the jump to ARM from x86. It's like electric cars... are they the future? Yes. Does that mean there's no demand for ICE cars? No. 

I think it's musical chairs for all three, and it's just about not being the one holding the bag when the music stops. That said, I think AMD has steam left.

You might look at Dell. It only has a PE of 4 but obviously AMD's good fortune is Dell's good fortune and vice-versa. Analysts can shit on it all they like, but I love their laptops, monitors and PowerEdge servers."

For a question of this specificity, I'd argue to hold all three and play the long game. 

Semiconductors will be used in many industries and appliances for years to come.

But if you really had to sell one, I'd pick AMD. However that's because I am personally closely following the competition between AMD and Intel and would throw the profits I made from AMD $12 to $150 into Intel as it is right now. 

Competition is wonderful and both Intel & AMD are key contenders in their fields when it comes to competition with some semblance of predictability to me.

Tl;dr; Hold onto your tech stocks. If anything, sell AMD and buy Intel now that the consumer perception for both companies have 'basically inverted'. Everyone claimed AMD would flop and reach the price it's at right now back in 2016/7. Now they're the ones screaming to buy AMD even though it's at a high as is. I could be wrong and it could go higher, but if you got in anywhere before 2021; you've made a profit either way."

They've consistently diluted your ownership by issuing shares over the past 2 years.  Apple on the other hand has increased your ownership of the company by 25% over the past 5 years due to share buy backs.  Personally I would wait for Apple to hit $150/share again before buying more, but I would consider dropping NVDA and AMD for Intel.  Intel has the profit that AMD and NVDA wish they had, has an average of 8% revenue growth YoY over the last 10 years, and has issued share buybacks during the process.  


However, if I had to pick between NVDA and AMD and which will net me a better return I would pick AMD.  The massive market cap of NVDA makes it hard for them to continue growing.  Also, AMD has initiated a share buyback program and is therefore beginning to offset the dilution that they caused over the past 2 years."

Eventually, it will even back out as the river slows back down. But imagine how much money you lose if you sell every time the herd moves sectors.

722,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,7.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T04:10:56Z,"I'm long all 3 stocks and QQQ. Here are my thoughts. 

* NVDA currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 83.4 times
* AMD trades at a P/E of 40
* Intel trades at a P/E of 10.6

>The [P/E ratio](https://investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20the%20P%2FE,is%20low%20relative%20to%20earnings) helps investors determine the market value of a stock as compared to the company's earnings. In short, the P/E ratio shows what the market is willing to pay today for a stock based on its past or future earnings. A high P/E could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings.

In my personal view, NVDA is an awesome company, but everyone knows that already, and it is priced in, meaning if you are buying NVDA, you must think it is going to do even better than everyone already thinks it will do (this is a very high bar). I would look to add around $200-$220. 

AMD is a similar story. I would look to add at $90-$100. 

I like Intel. I think it has the most surprise upside potential. If the situation with Russia/China gets worse, Intel would be in the best position because of their domestic & European manufacturing capability. I would look to add at $45."

AMD is the best price for its growth in my opinion. But it's at 40 p/e... you might get it at 30 p/e in the next 12 months. Still AMD has a lot of exposure to consumer PC markets. It's more discretionary than NVDA.  

NVDA is just too expensive, in my opinion because of the metaverse hype, but we are seeing the valuations contract. Maybe you get it at 40 p/e soon."
732,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,2.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T15:40:38Z,Like how you stated the 3 biggest bubbles if there was a crash
733,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,2.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T16:35:40Z,"As someone who’s been watching all 3 recently, here’s my take on what will happen.

1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we’re gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I’m sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.

2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don’t think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they’d grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it’s actually pretty fairly priced where it’s at. 

3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It’s about 60% off it’s ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it’s a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn’t been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi’s really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they’re undervalued, so they’re buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.

Of these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.

I think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They’ve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn’t mean a 20% drop couldn’t happen over the next few months.

Disclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed."

753,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:02:32Z,"I love all 3 so this is a great question. NVDA great verticals, sitting on a ton of cash, I can see them making a big move since ARM deal didn't go through, they will definitely buy something else. If they raise cash from creation of new shares (rumor currently) I believe this is confirmation that they will do something huge with the money. Sure they are trading at a high multiple but winners are expensive and NVDA is the industry leader.

AAPL the obvious question is how much bigger can they get but great products and could they be developing software for vehicles and partner with an auto maker? Probably the safest out of these 3."
754,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:04:15Z,I like Apple. Video card prices are dropping and Nvidia is between releases with their 4000 series RTX cards. Apple just prints money with their walled garden

760,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T09:13:17Z,I’d hold off as markets going to drop a bit more IMO. I’d buy SOXL which is currently $28.29 (might drop to $25 or lower in next few weeks). Ride it up to $35+ then sell then buy AMD which should be below $95. SOXL isn’t a buy and hold but but can salvage a portfolio quickly during a recovery like we just had.
761,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T09:23:23Z,"Personally I would say all three are overvalued at current prices (Nvidia>Apple>AMD). I don’t think you’ll necessarily lose money on any of these long term but it’s unlikely you’ll beat the index.
For those who can justify the high multiples (especially Nvidia) what growth rates are you expecting? 
Intel sub-50 seems a better bet to me."

It’s pretty clear the semiconductors are only going to be more and more important as time goes on.

ASML seems like the safest of them all to me. It's based on Europe so it has little geopolitical risk and is basically a monopoly. Doesn't matter who's making chips, ASML will be a beneficiary.

I like INTC because it's reasonably priced unlike some of the other semiconductor names and I think their foundry expansion plan is the right move and will likely succeed given they now have a respected engineer leading the company and that it's success has become an issue of national security. I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.

NVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like. AI, crpyto, gaming, data-centres, etc. They have a great CEO and loads of growth tailwinds. Even if it struggles because of its valuation short-term it's hard to see NVDA being a bad company to own long-term."

My picks are QCOM, NVDA, MRVL, AMD and INTC.

I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.  
  
I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it."

Nearly all chemicals have big cryogenic air-separation plants. Neon was mainly just too cheap, so that western producers did not produce it. 

The only impact is that price will go up, but from the supply side it is not a problem."

I doubt how successful Intel will be in establishing themselves as a foundry but at the same time doubt how capable other companies are of advancing their abilities beyond a point where Intel doesn't have any technological advance over them.

I think AMD and NVDA will need to invest more in their partnership with TSMC to stay relevant in the sense of deploying the latest technologies while Samsung is falling behind. So in other words the real battle will be between TSMC and Intel, where TSMC currently has a slight advantage but their execution needs to be perfect to expand it."

In leading nodes it's winner take all. Samsung might be the first to GAAFET, but it doesn't seem their node is actually better than FINFET by TSMC anyway.

Over the coming years, TSMC will increase the capacity for leading nodes to the point that they can supply $AMD with enough wafers. When that happens, there is a lot you can do with the increased supply of leading nodes, like a console mid-generation refresh, Steam Deck 2, etc. things that so far are not announced

But maybe $ASML is not able to deliver all of the machines everyone needs"
