Without a doubt this risk is offset with other positions. They are very good at correlation and basket trades. For example they could be short the S&P underlying stocks. 

In reality it‚Äôs going to be a combination of thousands of positions all viewed as a giant risk bucket. In the past their on floor option market makers didn‚Äôt even hedge anything. They‚Äôd trade based upon their screen price and all hedging was handled upstairs. 

Often times these huge positions are just funding trades. If your cost to borrow money is less than your competitor you can exploit that all sorts of ways, like a conversion/reversal. The bigger your book the lower your rates == little guys can‚Äôt compete. Multi-billion dollar stock position swing after an option ex are super common at shops that actually matter."

See answers to questions 41 & 43.  Institutions dont report any shorts, whether its shares or options they write.  Without that, the long positions they DO report are meaningless in terms of how these firms are positioned overall. 

For example, these spy calls could be part of call credit spreads (a bearish position), but there‚Äôs no fucking way to know because duhhhhhh they dont have to report the short legs.  

Till these firms are forced to report all their positions, and there‚Äôs actual penalties for not doing it - there‚Äôs very few reasons to look at these reports."

Honestly, if you're getting 200K (I'm assuming after tax? Taxes are gonna be rough for you buddy, make sure to set aside enough if your grandma didn't do a lot of fenagling)

If I didn't own a home, starter home or condo in Minneapolis, Minnesota in cash. Market is being floppier than a fish. Live in one of the rooms, and rent any extra rooms/beds to local college students. Use the rent to buy SPY calls or whatever bs.

I live in this frosty wasteland though. If I had 200K and it wasn't enough for local real estate in cash/I already have a home, here's what I'd do with it.

I'd set aside 44K to buy an Aptera, not the stock, the car, she looks very sexy. This is my vanity purchase. I'd also buy 5K of Aptera stock if they'd let me. They did trash in the past but I think they've learned from it, and have a real shot at EV market cap, specifically because they tackle the on-street parking problem. These are my vanity purchases though, replace with hookers or whatever.

Ukraine war is going to kick off some 1970s style energy problems, either now, or when world govts can no longer subsidize the bill. I'd hedge against that in my personal life. I'd spend 1K on an induction stovetop. I'd spend 1K on that bitcoin space heater (or honestly build my own bitcoin rig for the purpose of space heating with 1K, if I'm going to release energy for warmth, might as well get warmth and tendies). I'd buy a heat pump dryer for 1K. I'd spend 20K on rooftop solar. I'd spend 5K to upgrade my AC to an invertable heat pump AC. I already have LED lightbulbs, but if you wanted to do the poor person's version of this hedge, get LED lightbulbs. LED lightbulbs are easy, cheap, will ROI in this energy market more than SPY calls. My wild and crazy investments are possible because of a secure and steady homelife, this might seem like overkill to you, but if I got a windfall, it's what I'd do, so that I can make wild and crazy investments.

I'd set aside like 30K to max out retirement accounts this year or next year. This year you might be limited in your contributions depending on how it's treated. I keep my wild and crazy investments in a Roth IRA, and buy vanilla indexes in my Roth 401K. Take Uncle Sam's matching grant.

If we're talking me, I actually am an IRL autist, so I qualify for and would max out an ABLE account and all my healthcare savings accounts, and then if I really had a lot leftover, set up a foundation, the u/amy33amy33 foundation, and direct that foundation's money into wild and crazy investments, and giving the required amount to the poor. In my case, my foundation would probably buy the poor LED lightbulbs."

If you want to manage it yourself, drop it in indexes that include some Large cap, small cap, emerging markets, foreign developed, and bonds. You'll need to read up on the ratios. Also what type of equities (income or growth) and fixed income (corporate or municipal) will depend on your personal factors of ordinary income. All of this is also dependent on your time horizons and other sources of income.

Then there's the what do you accomplish with the money: Probably worth it to engage a Fiduciary RIA to do a quick planning project for you for anywhere from a $200-$2,000 fee as you plan out your life objectives that this might make possible. Maybe buy a house, maybe some of this you live off of so you can max out your traditional or Roth 401k for a few years to effectively convert some of it to tax-favorable retirement assets.

Short answer is to start big-picture and dial down. Tools (investment options and vehicles) will be determined by the job (life goals). That last guy who got $200k from his grandma is not even close the the first to burn through *sudden money*.

Under 35?  


Take $20k and take a couple weeks off, travel, and say hi to Vegas for me. Take $30k and put it in a savings account. Take $50k and gamble it away on weeklies. You have $100k left. Do something smart with it (QYLD, CLM, something with big dividends so you're not worried too much about share price).

35 or over but under 55?  


Take $20k and take a couple weeks off, travel, and say hi to Vegas for me. Take $30k and put it in a savings account. The other $150k either goes one of two ways. First, it could all go into some ETF that you won't think about again until you're 55. DCA if you're worried about market fluctuations or trying to avoid taxes. Second, it could go into finally diversifying your portfolio: maybe a REIT, maybe art, maybe metals - whatever you're into.  


  
55 or over?  


I'm assuming you have a retirement fund. This money could probably put it over your target. Do that if it's an option (look closely at your contribution limits). Have a mortgage? Get rid of it.   


  
None of the above matter if you have a strong net worth and this is just icing on the cake. In that case, I assume you know what to do with this money much better than I do. Turn it into an epic loss if you want."

u/adamsmith93 Unless you‚Äôre gonna long term hold ZIM, don‚Äôt follow the advice of the stooges recommending the stock for ONLY the $17 dividend. 

For the millionth time: when a stock pays a dividend, the share price is reduced by the dividend amount THE DAY IT IS PAID.

Let‚Äôs do some simple math:
- ZIM Price at close, 03/17/22: $89.30
- You invest $25k (small number for the smooth brains)
- You can buy 279 shares of ZIM. 
- You would be paid in dividends: $4,759. 

Now guess what? The share price is reduced by $17 at market open. 

Your $25k purchase of ZIM is now worth $20k. 

You made a piss poor trade here because:
- your money is tied up in ZIM until payout date in April
- stocks that pay huge dividends typically trade lower in subsequent sessions, i.e. they sell off. 
- the above math assumes the stock doesn‚Äôt trade lower leading up to the dividend payout date (meaning the best case scenario before you sell ZIM you only lose $5k ish, which is unlikely to happen; you‚Äôll lose more)
- this isn‚Äôt a qualified dividend payout, enjoy the higher taxation rate."

Which is probably why it won't happen yet. Since when did the general public correctly predict a crash?

The market still needs to pull back from the big run last month and it hasn't even pulled back 50% yet. I think the market is going higher after the pull back is done, get people thinking bad news doesn't matter and stonks only go up, etc., before it actually goes down."

There are those who have just stopped looking for work altogether, and the endless flood of illegals cross-border that surely aren't looking for legal employment.

Then there is the lesson many companies seem to have taken away from Covid minimum manning - ""if we got by then with a smaller workforce, we can do it all the time."" Instead of the exception, it's become the standard and force reductions have become common, especially where automation can fill the void more efficiently and at less cost.

What you need is for VIX to spike in a way similar to the beginning of the global pandemic, or the financial collapse of 08. Which clearly you think we are on the brink of if you think we will get such a spike in VIX to make these options profitable before they become ITM.

The biggest catalyst was the Fed meeting and that's already starting and I think we can all agree it's been priced in.  Barring China jumping in and Russia firing nukes I don't think we get below 400.  But you only paid about 2.90 so they can gain value with another pullback, I just wouldn't be holding them past that.
But what do I know, I just bought 3/18 425calls on Monday and I paper handed them yesterday."

Over the last 15 years , the Fed has been doing 4 QE , bringing the feds balance sheet to a 10x since 2008 ~ 
The 25 BP interest rate hike isnt gonna do shit to inflation we all know that . The fed is desperately hoping for supply chains to get better but the russian ukraine conflict made things alot worse .
In arround 3 weeks we get the Fomc protokoll where we see how fast the Fed is gonna sell off their balance sheet every month . (the thing that scared the market in 2018 , not the interest rates)
The difference between now and the last 15 years is inflation , QE 5 would only make inflation go nuts so i dont see that but hey , jpowell is kicking the recession down the road for so long , i guess political pressure is too high."

Housing markets will slowly correct course. You cannot expect people to borrow at higher rates which the fed has promised.  

Unless the US also goes into the war which will be the catalyst, we cannot see a catalyst to cause a crash in 3 months. Which is why indexers and retirements funds will continue to index and buy value and blue chips. Apart from buying bonds."

801,wallstreetbets,128k Profit on SPY Calls,7.0,tr0yho,2022-03-29T14:39:15Z,"How much was the premium cost? Like how much money would you have lost if the strike price wasnt met?  
I'm trying to learn about options.  
I just learned you can buy options that are like 900% out of the money, so why wouldnt someone buy a one year option for SPY at 500$ and as SPY ""probably"" will go towards that price in one year you would make gains?  
Like one dude got 900$ calls on GME, which is at like 200$ and he made profits because that 900$ call got worth more as GME got worth more and it seemed like it could hit that mark.  
I hope y'all know what I mean"

833,wallstreetbets,$SPY - Predictions for the week of 3/28,16.0,tp494n,2022-03-26T21:19:20Z,"5 day forecast, that's a new one"
834,wallstreetbets,$SPY - Predictions for the week of 3/28,11.0,tp494n,2022-03-27T01:50:30Z,"I predict Monday will be red.  There was a hanging man candle on the daily chart on SPY Friday.  Bought some 450 puts expiring Monday.  Got them for $1.02 per contract.  The volume on that strike was ridiculous.  Moreover, 453 is a major resistance right where it threw a hanging man.  Just a couple days before, there was a spinning top doji, suggesting a possible coming reversal.  All hanging man candles in last 3-6 months have all been followed by reversal days.  

OP is right.  No idea if this is just gonna be a pullback before another leg higher, but Monday will likely be red.  That‚Äôs my guess and bet.  

I‚Äôm overall bearish due to severe overvaluation of equities, bond yields and rates, inflation, housing market trends, etc.  

The only Rx and cure for inflation is to raise rates and induce a recession.  Never been successfully done without it in the past.  The Fed signaled last week they are ready to do that.  Inflation will absolutely kill this country if not aggressively dealt with."
835,wallstreetbets,$SPY - Predictions for the week of 3/28,29.0,tp494n,2022-03-26T21:32:13Z,"All the algos have been trained on datasets for the last 30 something years. 

In that timeframe, every time we have had a recession, the fed has lowered rates.

This time around, we are entering a recession, and fed is raising rates and reducing its balance sheet, as evidenced in the bond market. 

The algo's haven't been trained on such a scenario. There will come a point, when the algo's realize it is much less risk to put the money in treasuries and bonds, and will yank out money from the market. The floor from stocks will collapse, and we will see one of the reddest weeks ever. 

Just my thoughts on a Saturday afternoon."

873,wallstreetbets,If Susquehanna has $2T in Spy Calls..... what's the best way to get tendies?,106.0,tw4qoe,2022-04-04T19:02:15Z,"Ok, not trying to be an ass here, but you need to learn how 13F/Ga report options positions

The value you see is the total nominal value that the options *control*. If you had one SPY call and had to report it, you'd put $45,500 in your report.

So, first point of order, the value reported DOES NOT correspond to any value of the options held. Only the value of the controlled underlying.

Second point, note that in the above I didn't even mention strike or expiration. That's because for the 13F/G, those DO NOT MATTER AND ARE NOT REPORTED

So for all we know, those could be $480 calls or $1200 calls. Expiring next Friday or in two years. Who knows

I cannot know what is the exact thing going on here, but my hunch is Susquehanna is very short SPY (short positions don't need to be reported usually) and they are holding a lot of way OTM calls as a hedge to satisfy the risk department requirements"

If they're holding them as a hedge against puts then again they are large enough to move markets and the puts will print and the calls will be worthless.

966,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,0.0,ti7acr,2022-03-19T23:41:18Z,Interesting.
967,wallstreetbets,Thank you SPY ü•≤,38.0,th784g,2022-03-18T18:58:07Z,"This week was my best play on SPY and of course I feel like I fucked it up.  Bought 425c's on Monday for 2.6 a piece.  Expected a bounce after the FOMC meeting, but I paper handed them before the meeting because I was up over 200%.  If I held to close yesterday? 500%, today? 700%.  Even when I win I feel like a loser.
Edit- at expiration it was 840%. Beer it is tonight!"

1001,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",4.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T02:57:57Z,Caught that run up today for a 70% gain.  VIx was in a clear downtrend. And had just formed a bear flag. But SPY was red for 2 more candles even as VIX was getting ready to drop. Bought a call there and watched it go positive and never look back
1002,wallstreetbets,"4-8-22 SPY, QQQ, Apple Weekly TA",4.0,tzibj6,2022-04-09T02:52:49Z,Hindsight is 20/20

How likely is that, versus opening at 161 and then dropping to 153?

Still only just learning some of this stuff so what causes the gapped openings that we see, vs opening spikes?"

sToCkS oNlY gO uP ü§°

This market is going to absolutely crater in the next 12-24 months.  Another thing that people don't realize is that it doesn't happen overnight. 2008-2009 was spread out over a couple years. Gradual bleed off with little rallies along the way. 

Lastly, retail doesn't control the price of stocks. Large institutions control most of it. If the algos are programmed to sell, they will sell. Markets will fall. We are just along for the ride. What we are seeing now is any rips being immediately sold off. Momentum gets created by the institutionals who then use it to lure retail in for a beating. Rinse, repeat. Overall trend is down & that is not going to end anytime soon."

1104,wallstreetbets,3/16/22 SPY Daily Analysis.... is the bottom in ? or is this the next top?,13.0,tfw2l2,2022-03-16T23:40:58Z,"FYI - $437 is just below the SMMA 20 and SMMA 100, which just crossed the other day. The SMMA 20 is sitting almost right on $437.50, which is what it bounced off of.

There are other indicators I'm watching using a combination of channel analysis and Fib sequence patterns that put a key level at $435.70 give or take, which is where it settled.

Crossing the 20 day Smoothed Moving Average on a Bearish trend for more than 1 candlestick is an important indicator of a trend reversal. This moves roughly parallel the EMA 50.

If it follows that pattern (depends on whether it has enough buy to break it tomorrow) then the pattern indicates to me a bounce off these moving averages down to the mid-$420s give or take and then from there form a small inverse head and shoulders, which if realized should support a run to the mid-450s in the next month or two, depending on how long it takes the pattern to form IF it forms.

If it does that, then we'll have an inverse head and shoulders pattern within a larger possible inverse head and shoulders... which is similar to the pattern in Sept/October.

We shall see what happens."

Never risk a margin call by not using most of the margin I *could* use according to what my broker gives me. I also hold some of the ETFs as a large portion of my portfolio.

1168,wallstreetbets,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,15.0,txahip,2022-04-06T02:32:21Z,Thanks for the post. Quality post are lacking nowadays.
1169,wallstreetbets,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,8.0,txahip,2022-04-06T03:21:21Z,"Tomorrow is a difficult one to predict. I was bearish going into today & it paid off. Tomorrow could go either way. Patrick Harker (Philly Fed President) is speaking tomorrow morning at 9:30AM. That will kick things off. U.S. G7 are announcing sweeping new sanctions on Russia tomorrow too. Then we got FOMC minutes at 2PM.

Harker is a dove in my view (based on his recent interviews), so it'll be interesting to see what he says & if he's hawkish. 

More sanctions = more supply chain issues & inflation. The Ukraine/Russia situation seems to be getting worse overall, not better. The recent events around Kyiv seems to have caused an increase in inflammatory rhetoric & has likely made peace negotiations more contentious.

I could see one of a few different scenarios playing out. If Harker & FOMC minutes are dovish, we maybe get a green day. Sanctions are the fly in the ointment. 

Hawkish?.....we headed downtown. It's not even a question at that point."

1171,wallstreetbets,4/5/22 SPY Daily TA,3.0,txahip,2022-04-06T03:06:04Z,Good work.. those type of quality posts been missing. I have similar take with yours. Brainard has already (intentionally or unintentionally) scared the market today. So I feel like the FOMC meeting minutes could actually be dovish incoparison to her today's comments. So I see two scenarios. Either a run-up in the morning until the FOMC minutes and then goes down or the downtrend from today to continue in the morning and once the fomc minutes are out $SPY to spike-up like what happened in March 16th. I feel what ever damage has already been done today . So tomorrow might be an easy day

My QQQ plays were fucking stupid. They were butterfly‚Äôs that were far out of the money.

I bet very deep.

SPY is fucking me but will help me if it drops. It was a good play (it was up $800 at a time). For me to go green SPY needs to drop $40. I don‚Äôt want to wish loss for others but fuck others.

1217,wallstreetbets,4-7-22 SPY/ Apple Daily TA,6.0,tyq43j,2022-04-08T00:19:02Z,"Great Analysis. It's really hard to make sense of the crazy $SPY runs this week (it's way Meme now than any meme stock ) , I love that you actually explained the method to the madness ! I am leaning towards bearish action for tomorrow (also Fridays usually are red days ), but with the amount of put strikes that can close ITM if price goes down tomorrow, I feel the MMs might just run it between $448 & $450 the whole day eating both puts and call premiums"

1286,wallstreetbets,3/17/22 SPY Daily TA- Is the bull run officially back on?,-2.0,tgonj2,2022-03-18T09:47:51Z,"This statement clearly identifies that you don‚Äôt understand statistical probability‚Ä¶

‚ÄúStatistically speaking if spy opens red there is roughly an greater than 80% chance that SPY will also close red that day. Today we see that statistics are not always correct and why we have to put our biases behind us and focus on what the intraday chart shows us.‚Äù

An 80% chance doesn‚Äôt mean that if the event with 80% probability doesn‚Äôt happen that the statistics are ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù.  The event occurring with a probability of 20% happens 1 out of every 5 independent trials.  When that event with a probability of 20% occurs, it is just as ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù as when the event with 80% probability occurs.  And regarding your paywall you are erecting ‚Ä¶. I ain‚Äôt paying for DD from someone who doesn‚Äôt understand the basic fundamentals of how statistical probability works."

I‚Äôve traded 2 recessions. It‚Äôs not fun and we are at the tip of an even worse one than we had the last 2. I‚Äôm not talking the Covid bear market as that was fake and gay. You will get burnt to a crisp if you are emotionally tied to a bullish trend. Reasons we rallied, gamma gamma gamma, delta delta delta, and selling/rolling out Puts was bullish. Nobody was buying calls. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre stuck. Dealers are delta neutral. Wait until it pressures to the downside again. Bear market rallies are fun, but not sustainable. Way more variables to go along with a thesis. You‚Äôre looking at the tip of the iceberg and not exploring the 90% under the water. Good luck though."

I bought puts at the literal bottom last week. That's why it went up.

[VXX](https://www.tradingview.com/x/TdzroWJK/) Looks like it will bounce off its trendline and create a small pullback on SPY.

[SPY FROM OCTOBER SIMILAR TREND TO NOW](https://www.tradingview.com/x/DClXfKN0/) \- Looks very identical to what is happening now.

Any thoughts?

TLDR: We have a small rally back to 460-465 and reject decisively pulling us back to possibly 440-430 maybe even lower."

The future goes whatever direction it wants based on so many factors not related to charts and TA won‚Äôt decide that path. Trying to justify moves with TA is crazy and to be honest you‚Äôre better off just picking a direction IMO that spending that much time on TA just to lose your money.  

Markets aren‚Äôt going to move based on your charts, the charts are only there to show you the past.  If everything was as simple as a chart then we would all win all the time.  I‚Äôm pretty sure you know that as well.

Hopefully you make it back tomorrow or you‚Äôre better off just doing a yolo play on GME or Tesla!"

Saw the writing on the wall with Russia invading Ukraine and went in big.  But despite knowing that the market recovers immediately after things are official, I thought maybe the Fed would say something later that week to keep people spooked.  Literally watched the win completely turn red within a day and keep getting worse.  Bonus points for selling most of the puts before the reverse dead cat bounce which would have recovered a lot of losses.  
  
**18151.86 Gain on $GME Calls**.  When the borrow rate on Interactive Brokers spiked from 1% to 9% I had a feeling something was up, and somehow got in before Ryan Cohen bought a bunch of shares.  Then when the borrow rate spiked from 9 to 28%, I bought more calls.  Sold the calls to make up for the SPY losses, and this week I used some of the remainder to purchase a Jan 2024 GME $150 LEAP.  
  
Very proud that this Roth IRA is up 350% in the past 2 years (after years of falling behind), and half of it is currently sitting in cash right now.  You all have taught me a lot."

1666,stocks,SPY: Timing Prospective Recovery / March to May (FOMC),3.0,tejkh1,2022-03-15T12:04:31Z,">Also‚Äî it seems in the last five years (SPY history) the middle/end of March has a downturn then some solid recovery at least until end of April / beginning of May, before more uncertainty brews before the next FOMC.

The only time I see this on the chart is 2018 and then 2020 (a one off Covid event).  I think you may be grasping for straws on that one...


>(while of course so many macro economic factors)-is there another just huge overriding reason that this will continue to go down (unlike the SPY of the last five years during the period)?

So your question is:  Other than everything that matters in the economy (other macro economic factors), is there a reason that the market isn't going to completely reverse a hard down trend in the next few months just because everyone takes a breather in April?  I would put about 0% of my money into that theory.  

Some of those ""other macro economic factors"" that you may want to take into account:

The biggest issue facing the US economy right now is inflation and you haven't even mentioned it in your analysis.  

The second biggest issue facing the US economy right now is supply chain issues (which seem to be getting worse with China shutting down) and you haven't even mentioned it in your analysis.

The third biggest issue facing the US economy right now is that we are probably going to see a big congressional flip in November, which is going to quell the possibility of more free money which may be one of the only things that would turn the market around.  You haven't mentioned that in your analysis.

>I don‚Äôt want to miss out on the potential upturns, particularly if the aforementioned factors come into fruition and we see that V Shaped recovery.

What aforementioned factors?  Overall Ukraine/Russia isn't that big of an event for the US market.  Some companies took lumps because they are losing 1 - 3% of revenues with Russia sanctions and gas prices spiked but seem to be normalizing (back to an overall trend of going up due to underinvestment in infrastructure).  But if you go look at the last 4 months, the trend didn't accelerate when Russia invaded.  There may be a ""good news"" bounce just because everyone overacts, but that clearly isn't the reason the market is tanking."

1675,investing,What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?,65.0,tsirle,2022-03-30T21:11:04Z,">I know the options chain is obviously part of a certain % of volume (probably a small one) because puts/calls getting exercised will always trigger shares trading hands... right?

Market makers buy/sell the underlying asset as soon as they create the option. The options don't have to be exercised to drive flows.

So for example, you're a market maker. You sell a SPY 450 call for 100 shares. As SPY goes up and up, you'll keep buying a few more and a few more. Because your risk management department doesn't want it to get to 480, the buyer exercises it, and all the sudden you have to run out to the open market to buy all 100 at once."

I'd start with looking at what an ""institutional investor"" actually is. You seem to be under the misunderstanding that all institutions are some form of fee gouging entity. It's quite the opposite. The largest investors in the US are non fee charging institutions. In fact, they PAY fees. They collectively hold trillions of dollars in passive index exposure vehicles such as SPY, and many of them do it inhouse as well (basically, manage their own ETF). Start your search there to answer your questions.

For people with a mild interest in investing (i.e. people on this sub), I swear the two most misunderstood things/terms are 1) institutions and 2) hedge funds. This dynamic is magnified 100x when it comes to crypto investors."

As for the %, that‚Äôs a bad way to look at it, instead you can look at the GEX (gamma exposure) of the options market which tells you how many billions of dollars of futures market makers must sell or buy for a $1 move in the SPX.

Who places buy and sell orders on the exchange?

NYSE Arca offers three levels of exchange membership for financial firms that want to engage in market-making practices on the ECN.

1. Standard market-making requires that members actively maintain a two-sided market at all times in the names that they make markets in.

2. Lead market makers (LMMs) are the primary designated market maker in a given name and are held to more stringent standards and margin requirements.

3. The third status, ETP Holder, are financial institutions that do not wish to make markets but do want to use the exchange for order routing of exchange-traded products for their own books or on behalf of their brokerage clients.

As of fall 2021. NYSE Arca membership consists of around 150 member firms (https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/membership):

If you place a limit order on the market, and don't immediately match another order.. you've added an order to the order book.  That's a ""maker"" order, where you add liquidity to the market.  The flip side is someone placing a limit order that matches an existing order, or a market order - both are the ""taker"" in the trade.

You can confirm this with NYSE's own fee document, on page 2, below.  They show ""adding liquidity"" (maker) as having a negative 0.05% fee - they pay you.  Removing liquidity, a taker order, you pay 0.3%.  The point isn't the specific securities or specific percentages - it's that NYSE values those who add liquidity - and pay them - while charging those who take away liquidity.

1681,investing,What's a semi-accurate best guess on what parties are responsible (and at what % of volume) for the roughly 1-2b shares of SPY traded monthly on average?,1.0,tsirle,2022-03-30T21:28:05Z,"Me asking myself more questions and then doing research to see if I can figure out the answers

Fund Net Asset Value as of Mar 29 2022

NAV $461.45

Shares Outstanding 912.93 M

Assets Under Management $421,270.34 M

How often are more shares created/destroyed? I guess it makes sense. When I put a buy order in for SPY to say, Fidelity, it goes through many different layers. Fidelity probably has some internal reserves of SPY shares laying around on hand (or they might not and it goes through a clearing house or a market maker or one of the 150 member firms allowed to provide liquidity through the NYSE Arca exchange). I guess it's easy to track inflow/outflow of SPY based on # of shares outstanding? Not sure how reliable the number is or when it is updated. Daily?

But, in order for SPY to correctly follow underlying NAV (the actual index), based on how many people want shares (buying in or selling out) it has to create shares outstanding/destroy existing shares outstanding (I wonder if the destroy case is really uncommon)."

Edit: [Here's Susquehanna's 10F of 2021-12-31 on SEC's EDGAR website](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1446194000144619422000002/0001446194-22-000002-index.htm). I'll look into the actual filing later. The imputed share prices for the calls/puts for other tickers (Electric Car stonk, bust out scheme stonk, search bar stonk) are exactly the same, yet the imputed share price for SPY calls/puts differ wildly:

* SPY Put $476.16 / SPY Call $54,917.18.

I want to look into this more, but it looks like they (deliberately?) fucked up the imputed share prices. But why?

‚Äî ‚Äî¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äî¬†‚Äî

Edit 2: Downloaded the XML data and compared the SPY values with a base case (Electric Car Stonk). I formatted it in a spreadsheet, because fuck XML. [Click here to see an image of the sheet.](https://i.imgur.com/Qsfdnzz.png)

As we can see, the *""Imputed Share Price""* (I'll abbreviate this as ISP) (calculated as `1000 * (value / sshPrnAmt)`) for the SPY Calls held by Susquehanna Securities LLC is definitely fucked up: **$54,920.00 per ssh**, taking the average ISP of all SPY Calls held by Susquehanna Intrnational Group to the $54,917.18 as shown on Fintel.

The ISP of the calls held by their other companies (Darby Financial Products and Susquehanna Investment Group) seem legitimate: **$475.83** and **$475.71**. The ETF was at that price between Dec \~23 to Dec 31 (Reporting period).

I think somebody fucked up. Accidentally, or deliberately.

Sorry if I missed this, but I don't understand that. Also does it mean the etf's should be rebalanced? Isn't there is a shitstorm each time any of the etf's with gme is being rebalanced?

Looks like a lot of these positions are investing in a straddle with the SPY calls obviously being sketch but depending on the ‚Äúprice of the hedges/date bought‚Äù vs ‚Äúprice of corresponding position we don‚Äôt have the full picture as to ‚Äúhow sketchy‚Äù this is yet. 

Most likely it‚Äôs super sketch though or perhaps they were buying calls in bulk as a cheap way to force mass buying on correlated shares to hedge the delta variable which in turn would drive the price. 

Plus if they drive too much, ‚Äúforced buying‚Äù, it could eventually create share supply shortages / maybe forced market makers to create more shares out of thin air? Or at least make it look like they were ‚Äúforced to do so‚Äù which could give them a broader long term argument that this was a market wide issue and not tied to any one firms abuse. :(

****** Editing below to add notes/also please do critique any errors, but most should be pretty accurate******

 I see people saying the purchase price is $54,000 (I‚Äôm too lazy to read the article lol) - this would imply a dummy low Delta buuut there could still be a HUGE quasi arbitrage opportunity. 

** an index option would be massively harder to maintain an accurate spot (live market) calculation of the Black Scholes Model (formula for options) vs a raw stock option, in general. 

** This provides the hypothetical technical basis that market arbitrage scenarios could occur as we know people are 100% capable of making a few small changes behind the scenes. 

Ex. If someone ‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù changed a 1x multiplier to 100x on the delta causing the .0001 ‚Äî> .01 || then 1 spy contract forces the purchase of .01 ‚Äî> 1 shares which has a relative effect elsewhere on the underlying assets in a positive manner.

Or

Even as simple as shits just already so misconstrued/messed up w these funds that it was already know to the insiders to be ‚Äúincorrectly‚Äù weighted. 

** not saying the above happened but options are primarily to Hedge, Speculate (w reason esp w client funds), and Increase Gains on Long Positions by Selling them. 

********** someone w BBG access, discover the Delta and other option metrics vs purchase price for that day and we‚Äôll have the best info to actually create evidence / burden of doubt. We can also calculate the Black Scholes Model by hand to determine if they had an unfair advantage in how the model was working vs how it should have been working."

The top investments by $$ are all options and all for like SPY, Amazon, fb, and Tesla. Calls and puts.   

Not sure what it means, but it definitely makes me think these people are making bags off volatility no matter which way it goes, on top of their market maker side making money skimming off the top of every transaction. 

Important to note that options are priced in a weird way for this kind of reporting.  

It basically takes the date the report was required to be filed, and multiplies the share price that day * number of shares represented by the type of options (calls or puts). I think this makes it so they could like have call options with basically no chance of being ITM being listed on a balance sheet as 100 * # of call contracts * share price that day. Same for puts. Basically it‚Äôs possible these values are inflated with some of them having zero chance of being ITM and having that amount become realized. So it‚Äôs definitely a very shitty way of pricing the things on a balance sheet but oh well I guess."

The bad news is when the Fed steps in to fight the inflation. High rates will reduce access to credit and dampen demand. The Fed can raise interest rates, increase reserve requirements, and reduce its balance sheet to fight inflation. All of which can reduce demand and damage production, but the key metric on where the market goes is credit creation. 

When the Fed initiates QE he prints new money and buys treasuries and MBS. This creates a flood of cash pushing up prices on the assets they are spent on. In QT he reverses that trade by selling Treasuries and MBS for cash ultimately reducing the money supply. 

This access to infinite money has bolstered asset prices as those able to use the repo market get the advantage of spending money hot off the press to buy assets before they rise. The reason they rise is 100% due to the use of the very same hot money being spent on those assets. It‚Äôs a guaranteed win for those spending the cash. 

When the Fed closes down the QE and actively tightens it will send asset prices plummeting as the only reason they are rising is from the printing press flooding the markets with cash. If he stops the taps, the market will quickly react as the upward pressures will disappear."

2106,Superstonk,SPY 2008 Correlation Tracker Day 49 (They are still the same picture.),19.0,ty9cfx,2022-04-07T09:38:12Z,"# Wut dis?

Looks like they found their algos from 2008 again. So ‚ÄãI decided to track and compare the current SPY chart with the one from 2008 when we reached the top and started crashing, since as of right now the last months do look eerily similar. But it's not like anything in here should be taken as a ""prediction"" or financial advice. Just another ""coincidence"" and some fun.

There was already a post here with an overlay between 2008 and now on the SPY, however I think the time scale on the 2008 overlay was more compressed. This here has a more similar timescale between the charts and coincidentally I think it correlates even closer that way (even though it indicates one more upswing since I started).

The bottom 1D chart is showing the months leading into the 2008 market crash with a top of around $158. It was going down from there to an intra-day low of 67 on March 6 2009 (not shown).

The top 1D chart is showing the same chart but as of today. Turns out ""this is the same picture"".

# Interesting to note

According to the 2008 chart there was one more upswing in September 2007 to the very top and then it all started to spiral down. That's an interesting timing in the current timeline (as of February 2022) as well, since we may get 1 more upswing.

But March-April is going to get interesting as this is when the Fed plans to increase rates for the first time and more importantly there's this idiosyncratic risk of a certain security releasing their Q4 earnings along with the newest DRS high-score. Speculation: the next few months could continue to look similar to 2008 even from a fundamentals perspective.

# Buckle up

Since we're talking about the crash of 2008, we might as well talk about the VW squeeze. It's interesting to note here that VW started rising slowly but surely throughout the crash and finally squeezed to the top in October 2008 and remained elevated for around another year. But the circumstances where different back then. Hedgies won't get out that easy this time around.

# Disclaimer

Don't dance. I am not trying to predict or hope for a market crash and it goes without saying this is no financial advice. Also: Every time anyone comments how the ""You are here"" arrow doesn't make any sense, god kills a kitten."

Looks like they found their algos from 2008 again. So ‚ÄãI decided to track and compare the current SPY chart with the one from 2008 when we reached the top and started crashing, since as of right now the last months do look eerily similar. But it's not like anything in here should be taken as a ""prediction"" or financial advice. Just another ""coincidence"" and some fun.

There was already a post here with an overlay between 2008 and now on the SPY, however I think the time scale on the 2008 overlay was more compressed. This here has a more similar timescale between the charts and coincidentally I think it correlates even closer that way (even though it indicates one more upswing since I started).

The bottom 1D chart is showing the months leading into the 2008 market crash with a top of around $158. It was going down from there to an intra-day low of 67 on March 6 2009 (not shown).

The top 1D chart is showing the same chart but as of today. Turns out ""this is the same picture"".

# Interesting to note

According to the 2008 chart there was one more upswing in September 2007 to the very top and then it all started to spiral down. That's an interesting timing in the current timeline (as of February 2022) as well, since we may get 1 more upswing.

But March-April is going to get interesting as this is when the Fed plans to increase rates for the first time and more importantly there's this idiosyncratic risk of a certain security releasing their Q4 earnings along with the newest DRS high-score. Speculation: the next few months could continue to look similar to 2008 even from a fundamentals perspective.

# Buckle up

Since we're talking about the crash of 2008, we might as well talk about the VW squeeze. It's interesting to note here that VW started rising slowly but surely throughout the crash and finally squeezed to the top in October 2008 and remained elevated for around another year. But the circumstances where different back then. Hedgies won't get out that easy this time around.

Don't dance. I am not trying to predict or hope for a market crash and it goes without saying this is no financial advice. Also: Every time anyone comments how the ""You are here"" arrow doesn't make any sense, god kills a kitten."

It is best to understand that with inflation running hot and interest rates about to rise, the real variable you need to look at is the Fed‚Äôs credit creation. 

Right now he is blasting headlines about interest rates, but the fact that he is tapering and could tighten is the big news being glossed over. That is what‚Äôs going to drill this thing to the ground.

2213,Superstonk,SPY 2008 Correlation Tracker Day 38 (tHE YoU aRE HeRE aRrOW MAkeS nO sENse!!1),1.0,tkr5vp,2022-03-23T10:51:06Z,"# Wut dis?

Looks like they found their algos from 2008 again. So ‚ÄãI decided to track and compare the current SPY chart with the one from 2008 when we reached the top and started crashing, since as of right now the last months do look eerily similar. But it's not like anything in here should be taken as a ""prediction"" or financial advice. Just another ""coincidence"" and some fun.

There was already a post here with an overlay between 2008 and now on the SPY, however I think the time scale on the 2008 overlay was more compressed. This here has a more similar timescale between the charts and coincidentally I think it correlates even closer that way (even though it indicates one more upswing since I started).

The bottom 1D chart is showing the months leading into the 2008 market crash with a top of around $158. It was going down from there to an intra-day low of 67 on March 6 2009 (not shown).

The top 1D chart is showing the same chart but as of today. Turns out ""this is the same picture"".

# Interesting to note

According to the 2008 chart there was one more upswing in September 2007 to the very top and then it all started to spiral down. That's an interesting timing in the current timeline (as of February 2022) as well, since we may get 1 more upswing.

But March is going to get interesting as this is when the Fed plans to increase rates for the first time and more importantly there's this idiosyncratic risk of a certain security releasing their Q4 earnings along with the newest DRS high-score. Speculation: the next few months could continue to look similar to 2008 even from a fundamentals perspective.

# Buckle up

Since we're talking about the crash of 2008, we might as well talk about the VW squeeze. It's interesting to note here that VW started rising slowly but surely throughout the crash and finally squeezed to the top in October 2008 and remained elevated for around another year. But the circumstances where different back then. Hedgies won't get out that easy this time around.

# Disclaimer

Don't dance. I am not trying to predict or hope for a market crash and it goes without saying this is no financial advice."
