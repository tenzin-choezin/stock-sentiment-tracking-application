533,wallstreetbets,Anyone else about to go balls deep in $TSLA?,5.0,tv3c4v,2022-04-03T20:52:58Z,"Take a look at the daily and how far we've come up so fast.  Typically, we see a 50% retracement with a fast vertical stock move.  If you look at the daily I would expect a drop to the $900 - $950 price range before testing the recent highs near $1,115 again.  Obviously speculation but look at Oct. 14 - Nov. 3 as an example... Went up almost $400 from $818 to $1,215 then retraced back to $1,000 in a matter of 4 days.  Took a week to get back up to that $1,200 for a retest but that's a 20% profit if you waited to go long on the 50% retest. 

I expect TSLA to do a similar move on this since we've essentially had 10 green days in a row mostly vertical.  Give it till Wednesday or Thursday when it's in the $900 - $950 range and then go long for the expectation of it retesting that $1,115 range.  But what do I know, I'm just here for the memes."

719,wallstreetbets,Beating the current market by automatically DCAing into TSLA when it dips. Thoughts on this strategy,1.0,tz4p5l,2022-04-08T17:05:35Z,TSLA is overvalued by every measure.  Eventually it must adjust but who knows that may be 5 years from now. GME is greatly overvalued unless there is a squeeze but who knows who blinks first.  I still prefer DCAing by investing $X every month or 2 months rather than waiting for a dip. These stocks show some steady upward movement making it hard at times to get below 200 day moving average.   Dollar cost averaging is by its very nature the opposite of a timing play but you seem to have made it one.

Just have to be able to time your buys and sells a bit better and be ok with taking multiple 30-100% gains instead of holding on for those epic once every few months 10-20 baggers"

878,wallstreetbets,"Stock splits: buy TSLA, GOOGL, or AMZN?",2.0,twvamp,2022-04-05T15:57:24Z,"If you can afford all 3, split your profile to suit all 3.  
IF you have to take 1, take Amazon. Retail is slowly dying out and everytime the highstreet loses value, Amazon gains value. It's growth potential is still absolutely huge, it has virtually no competitors (and nobody is even trying to, in all honesty). The others both have competitors, that could somewhat displace them sometime in the future."
879,wallstreetbets,"Stock splits: buy TSLA, GOOGL, or AMZN?",1.0,twvamp,2022-04-05T14:14:34Z,"correct me if im wrong please... but historically before every stock split the stock rallies then the split happens and the stock normally gets sold off and falls in price that was the case with apple at least then it traded sideways for months before it started to gain again with earnings etc.

So why buy stock specially if you missed the initial run up like in teslas case why not just buy leaps when the stock splits and ride those for a year or two. For one they will be much cheaper since the price has been reduced and you will still make the same amount of money if not more since you can now afford to buy more calls or even shares at that point.

Edit: I should clarify im not saying tesla shares are going to fall in price after the split but they will remain stagnant for a while or they could rocket as the stock would be much more affordable for young investors... but i think some of you are confused as to you making more money when the stock splits. Your one share is now 10 shares etc but your money does not change.. Its the same as you waiting for the stock to split and buying the same amount of shares at that price instead of jumping in when the stock is close to ATH"

Supply chain issues will cause less earnings this quarter. If not that then just think about the Shanghai factory being closed. It’s abt to tank bud. PE ratio is over 200!!

1066,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,2.0,ti7acr,2022-03-22T23:47:34Z,Once again your tactical trading idea was excellent. Well done my friend
1067,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,9.0,ti7acr,2022-03-19T23:44:30Z,"Spy goes up $25 dollars in 4 days because of FOMC hype. 

And suddenly people think the bear market is over? 😂

None of the things you listed have magically disappeared lol China just had another major lockdown. Covid is still a thing even tho it’s definitely not as bad as before.Supply chain is still just as bad as ever. Russia/Ulkraine is still brewing but nobody knows what to expect now.

This is literally the pump that happens before shit goes down hard again. If we are even get a smidgeon of bad news concerning these things people are going to panic sell to lock in profits."
1068,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,5.0,ti7acr,2022-03-19T23:23:05Z,For me it totally makes sense. I'm thinking the same way.

1071,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,2.0,ti7acr,2022-03-20T00:10:19Z,Market is short term bullish but medium to longer term bearish

1076,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,1.0,ti7acr,2022-03-20T15:00:02Z,It looks like you have a call debit spreads at different price start and stops. What's the thought there? Why not just make everything spy 440c/444c ?
1077,wallstreetbets,SPY and TSLA Callapalooza,1.0,ti7acr,2022-03-20T16:11:30Z,"I see a SPY correction this week. Not saying your wrong with these plays, but it will probably reset and do another bounce"

How likely is that, versus opening at 161 and then dropping to 153?

Still only just learning some of this stuff so what causes the gapped openings that we see, vs opening spikes?"

TSLA’s meteoric rise was a result of the fed’s QE. Inflation + expanded balance sheet —> bonds are dogshit. Most bonds have negative returns. Which forces people to speculate in the stock market

And the EV industry is the pinnacle of this excess speculation. “EV’s are the future bro” said all the retarded finance bros as they poured their money into consumer cyclicals. At its IPO, rivian had a higher market cap than ford without having made a single vehicle. Nikola, a literal scam, was valued more than subaru and mazda combined. 

Sure, tesla is definitely better than rivian or nikola. But it’s valuation is still totally ridiculous. Tesla’s market cap is almost the entire rest of automotive industry combined. If you think that valuation is supported by the fundamentals, you’re too retarded for even wsb. Head over to one of the spinoff subs like r/wsbcrypto or r/wsbhuzzah"

1396,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,21.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:27:56Z,I think we should all just go back to MySpace. Tom was such a good man
1397,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,4.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T13:23:39Z,"The SEC lets Citadel and Blackrock cheat investors everyday and does nothing but Elon buys some stocks and files a paper just a few days late and it is the end of the investing world to them , the SEC board is corrupt , bought and paid for , so why did this action not take a year like all the other actions they prosecute ?"
1398,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,3.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:55:06Z,I hope nothing happens to tesla stock
1399,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,6.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:50:08Z,vanguard is its shareholders mostly. they probably bought in because people think Elon buying into Twitter is a good sign.
1400,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,5.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:29:17Z,"Elon doesn't want to be on the board. He is pretty busy. Between Space X, Tesla, Starlink.  He just wants to Tweet out some BS directives once in a while to the company. From the comfort of his toilet. An actual board position would come with rules and responsibilities. Elon ain't got time for that.  He can just be the defacto ruler afar with the weight of his stake behind him."
1401,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,6.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:55:32Z,"He’s not excited. He’s scared.  Why they want him on the board so bad, to limit the damage they think he’ll do"
1402,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,5.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:25:26Z,Vanguard has a few active funds but almost all of their funds (the ones that people put money in at least) are literally just tracking other indexes. They make 0 out of the norm decisions. They are matching indexes for the most part. If you want to say these indexes are corrupt... eh go ahead. I just don't understand why people believe vanguard is controlling the market actively
1403,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,2.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:55:11Z,"There's a time for pump,
A time to sell
A time to baghold.

Learn or baghold"
1404,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,2.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:14:26Z,"Jokes on vanguard, elon doesnt care about the $"
1405,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,5.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:56:12Z,And no one’s going to make Elon broke.  It’s impossible
1406,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,4.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T11:55:57Z,"Dude Vanguard is largely passive investment funds. 

The first suspect for any holding increase is net inflows to Vanguard, the second suspect would be factor based rebalancing on the factor focussed funds they run (the latter is rule based rebalancing not discretionary).

The likelihood of Vanguard participating in a “war” for control is zero."
1407,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:16:13Z,Vanguard is not a hedge fund.
1408,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:29:10Z,Eloncumsimpinu to the moon
1409,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T13:01:21Z,it is very interesting!
1410,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T13:03:03Z,What makes you think Elon rejected board seat? He tweets certainly suggest otherwise seeing as he was looking forward to the next board meeting. It is Twitter board that has a change of heart in the span of a week.
1411,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T13:24:14Z,I hope Elon buys up AMC and makes us all rich
1412,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T14:27:56Z,"Retail is getting grifted some more, being told to help buy twitter with Elon because of poison pill. So they can get diluted too?

Clowns"
1413,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,1.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-14T00:43:48Z,"I think Elon is a dick and the power that be are telling Elon to eat it...

His messiah complex is about to get raptured big time 😂"
1414,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,-14.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T12:02:00Z,"Elon Musk is a shit person and Tesla is a shit racist and sexist company. Fuck them both, he could have used the money he inherited for good but all he did was prove that he's just as racist and shit as his parents and grandparents . 

Elon refused the chair because he didn't want to do a background check anyone who is not a dick rider can see how that is highly suspicious."
1415,wallstreetbets,I love Elon. I love TSLA. But I am concerned....,0.0,u2oh4u,2022-04-13T13:16:02Z,The real question others need to ask is given a sufficiently wealthy individual like Elon is he coming for us next? At a point certain individuals will have absolute or near absolute power to buy most companies not in the top market cap

I don't always trade every day. I will have the charts opened, my ticker screeners and forecast/priced in news catalysts (like Powell's talk tomorrow on the 23rd). I rarely force a trade I am not comfortable with.

Today, I felt like playing with options a bit. I took some large positions and they worked out in my favor. I trade aggressively and close profits quickly.  Keep in mind, I am not all inning my portfolio here. There is still risk management being employed. I would recommend not trading your entire portfolio as you can blow up very quickly. 1/7 or 1/8 is a good risk for your account.

Stay away from options trading, especially intra day, if you are a beginner. Before stocks, I was trading crypto (yikes) and I've seen it all so I do have a decent gauge of trend and pattern analysis with just using my moving average, order book, and candle volume.

Overall, solid day. I'll be pulling out 50% of whatever I make by the end of the month and reinvesting (trading) the rest."

If you're looking just at fundamentals, it makes no sense and that's what the bears will say. Competition has been coming for 5+ years now but the competition is a joke. They're racing to where Tesla was 5-10 years ago and still can't manufacture EVs at scale profitably. Key words, scale and profitably. Before they said Tesla would never turn a profit, nobody would want an EV, it just wasn't possible... like reusable rockets.  

Tesla is one of, if not the, best way to invest in the clean tech revolution. They've nailed down supply contracts that competitors haven't yet. Everyone will face shortages in the next few years but Tesla will navigate the best through this (like the chip shortage). They've proven they can expand at record speed and efficiency compared to anyone else. And they have orders already for the rest of the year. Nobody can copy their gigapress process because the press manufacturer is so backlogged for Tesla and the metallurgic compound required to use this process is owned by SpaceX. You're not JUST getting Tesla out of the stock, but Elon and SpaceX. And utility scale energy will ramp up pretty soon with profits from auto bidder and in-car app purchases adding for recurring revenues from already sold items. Ford and GM could never get additional revenues on already sold items. The economics of the business is being completely revamped. 

Personally I redirected by career from o&g into sustainable energy after reading Elons biography in 2015. Everyone called me crazy at the time. Now the company I work for has grown ~3-4x every year since 2019 and our potential prospects by 2030 are what's really crazy. Some bears just stay bears until it's too late and they miss out. You do you and follow your gut with solid DD. I don't love his personality, but he's the change society needs before we completely fuck over the planet. The richest person and most successful company should be the one that pioneers through the clean energy revolution.

Edit: spelling and grammar 
And to add on... legacy auto has tremendous piles of debt and diminishing sales. GM who was the top selling manufacturer in US for decades just officially lost that crown. Of course TSLA multiples should be higher than how they are valued if they can sustain these levels of growth throughout the decade. It doesn't take much to see the path they are on and where they could be by 2030 and get excited."

It is already valued higher than most of the other car companies combined.

&#x200B;

>From what I see, no company can produce EVs as cheaply, as high quality and as many as Tesla (not even Chinese EVs).

Look at the recent reliability data. Tesla is dead last, even behind Dacia. Also other car manufacturers are slow to adapt but then fast. Tesla does not have the ability to produce 10m cars yearly. Toyota and VW do.

&#x200B;

>They have the trifecta of manufacturing and EVs are still in the early adoption phase. Legacy auto makers have stagnant evaluations for the last decade.

Sure, but they pumped billions more into research than Tesla did, and current offerings from Hyundai, Kia and Porsche are considered excellent already. Adoption phase does not matter, as it is already valued as though it would surpass the others.

>Tesla is also the current leader in FSD technology,

Where do you have the data? Musk promised since 2015 that it is basically solved and it will be here next year. Mercedes is the first Level 3 car with included liabilities and Venmo and Cruise are already driving in selected cities without a driver. How is FSD the leading technology?.

&#x200B;

>although it has a long way to go, growth in AI is exponential and we will get there eventually within a reasonable time frame.

Yeah no. Even if everything goes smoothly, Level 5 autonomy everywhere will take at least a decade.

>Tesla is going to be more of a robotaxi company than a car company. The economic gain of robotaxis is going to be insane, cars sit idle 95% of the time any decent economist will tell you that is money being lit on fire. If they can reduce that to just 70% idle, it will result in at least a trillion saved by not requiring a driver, increased speed of traffic, reduced accidents, and most importantly (in US and Canada) not being financially burdened by owning a car just to name a few.

I think you should do your calculation how much it actually saves (it is not a lot) - and how much it costs to maintain a vehicle that is driving most of the day. The driver of taxi companies gets around 30% of the fare. Include the R&D costs of robotaxis and I can't see, how margins will be better than taxi companies (they have terrible margins).

&#x200B;

>It is more correct to say a Tesla revolution than an EV revolution.

How? It does not change how most people use their car. Au contraire, with increased competition, Tesla will either be forced to produce a cheap car -  so that they can really produce the amount of cars they are valued for - and thus decreasing margin, or they can have high margins with selling not a lot of cars. Either way, the multiple will suffer.

>I did my research on TSLA back in mid 2021 and I strongly believe that today, in terms of information available and TSLA financials, is the best time to invest because there is very little uncertainty. If your bearish on Tesla I want to know why and if I'm missing anything in my arguments.

If Tesla is your best idea, please search again. Also: Please look at the materials that go into a Tesla. Most of them more than doubled the last year -  decreasing margins further."

They have a real product that is in demand and have grown themselves very successfully. They have several promising future growth tracks. They also have exploded in value at lightning speed based mostly on the expectation of how much money they will bring in the future. Realistically I’m sure the company will continue growing, I imagine both top and bottom line numbers will sharpen, but they still need to catch up to their market cap. Even excellent growth across their projects would be very hard pressed to see them more than double or triple their market cap over the next decade. So in short Tesla looks like a solid long term hold to me even at these prices, but it’s not going to repeat its price growth from the last ten years"
1519,stocks,Those who are bearish on TSLA what are your main talking points?,75.0,tny5je,2022-03-25T20:47:45Z,"Despite bull claims, Tesla is indeed an automotive manufacturer. It’s currently valued more than every other major automotive manufacturer combined, despite manufacturing a tiny fraction of the collective.

Like other manufacturers, it’s going to face cyclical demand cycles like any other automotive company. It enjoys wide profit margins now, where it has legitimate pricing power, that will likely get squeezed as other manufacturers release viable competition over the coming years, including their increased demand in the commodities constituting pays unique to EVs. Continued quality and service issues are more of an issue as more competitors that can offer traditional build quality and service networks come online.

Personally, I also despise Musk. He’s a pie in the sky dreamer who knows how to market, but the timeline claims, AI claims, Solar claims/lies, Solar self dealing, SpaceX reusability claims, mars missions claims, hyperloop claims, and the disaster that is the “mass transit” solution for the Vegas convention center have lost all credibility for him as anything other than a good engineer willing and able to bankroll projects and say whatever he has to in order to stay in the news.

I also still remember the accounting mass exodus from a few years ago, where they seemed to have senior accounting out finance staff resigning every other week. While I trust PWC as an auditor, it’s a red flag still waving in the back of my mind.

TL;DR I don’t trust Elon and think Tesla is valued for practical perfection when perfection is unlikely."

1522,stocks,Those who are bearish on TSLA what are your main talking points?,8.0,tny5je,2022-03-26T16:58:08Z,"I'll just say this since this topic has been rehashed so many times it's not even worth a lengthy discussion anymore.

1. From 2013 to 2019, I actually lost money on Tesla. While my Amazon, Apple, and Netflix shares skyrocketed, I was losing money holding Tesla for six years. So when you look at Tesla's gains from 2019-present, consider that these gains were only possible due to groundbreaking mass manufacturing capabilities by Tesla. You guys make it seem like it was smooth sailing all the way through. Average out those gains and it's not as ridiculous as you guys are making it seem.
2. ""But Tesla is valued more than the next whatever auto companies combined."" Yeah, because traditionally, auto companies are boring to invest in. Before Tesla showed up, how many posts did you read about for auto companies? How many times can you talk about Ford's new truck having brighter headlights? It was boring. And the markets valued it as such because vehicle sales were predictable and linear. Tesla changed how vehicle companies are valued because of the amount of tech and software they are bringing into the industry. When you invest in Tesla, you'll realize just how much new shit they are involved in. You guys are so used to legacy automakers pumping out the same garbage with zero innovation which is why it's unimaginable that Tesla can do something spectacular. Hate Tesla all you want but don't deny that the auto industry was boring before Tesla showed up. And why was it boring? NO INNOVATION. Corporate CEO's who only focused on profit and bottom line items.
3. If it's so easy for ICE companies to transition, they would be fully EV by now. Yet, they plan on going fully EV by 2030-2040 while spending upwards of $40 billion. When you compare ICE sales to EV sales, realize that Tesla has been working on EV's for over 13 years. Comparing ICE to EV sales negates the fact that Tesla has been putting in serious work for 13 years. Why do you not put any value into that? Tesla has a first-mover advantage that needs to be considered here. If you measure every EV sale = one ICE sale, you're also confused about the industry and thus, your opinion is highly questionable. I keep hearing about GM. Do you guys not know GM's only EV, Chevy Bolt, has been halted from production for over six months because of exploding batteries? Again, so easy, right? So easy that GM can't figure out how to even produce a working EV right now to scale?

Tons of other stuff I could get into but I truly don't think many of you even know how to grasp the severity of the industry. I mean, I've read it all.

* EV's? Who will want to buy that? Lol, fad company.
* Tesla will go bankrupt. Elon is sleeping in the factory. Lol, short it!
* Tesla won't be profitable. They can't even produce their Model 3 on scale.
* Tesla is only profitable because of regulatory credits.
* Tesla is profitable? So what, look at their P/E of 800. Idiot.
* So what if Tesla's P/E dropped to 200? Look at Ford and GM's P/E bro.
* Just wait for the competition. It's coming.Competition: ""We are going fully EV by 2035.""

What's true is from that timespan, I've made insane money from Tesla. I've read every concern (some were valid) and Tesla continues to exceed my expectations. You can sit idle chirping on the streets or you can make some money. You do you."

1530,stocks,Those who are bearish on TSLA what are your main talking points?,15.0,tny5je,2022-03-25T21:51:55Z,"Three key factors for me here:

1) A lot of Tesla's high valuation seems to be based on their high margins, which are assumed to be sustainable with the about 40-50% increase in YoY production over the next 7-10 years they are currently valued for. That would make them account for about 25% of global EV sales, which in and of itself would be astounding. However I find it extremely unlikely for such a scale to be reached without a steep loss in margins simply for the fact that as of now, their cars are definitely on the high-end/somewhat luxurious side of things. So without introducing more mainstream models (which naturally come at lower margins) they will not be able to achieve the market penetration they are currently valued for, but even if they do, they won't sustain the margins they are valued for.

2) I'm having a hard time buying the narrative of insane demand for Tesla cars.  
a) There has hardly ever been any real competition for the majority of their presence as an EV maker, which is definitely beginning to change. b) I recently went on Tesla's website to order a car for fun's sake. What honestly scared me from an investment perspective is that you could basically order a car and were told that you'd be on a waiting list and informed when one would become available and were basically guaranteed that you could cancel the order even at that point without incurring any fees. This made me question the reliability of the oft-cited order backlog. 

3) Tesla is valued for flawless execution of some of the most bullish assumptions that I've ever seen put on a company. But as long as somewhat realistic valuation principles are applied, my upside would then be limited to whatever they can deliver on top of those already supremely ambitious assumptions. I just don't see them delivering to what they are priced for in the long run, especially with how markets seem to be irrationally overreacting to miniscule events that should theoretically already be priced in by a large margin (I'm looking at you, Hertz order). They basically added $100b in market cap over an order worth roundabout $6b, which should have already been priced in in the first place in terms of demand. So it definitely seems to me that the stock's price movement is decoupled from reality and driven by greed, FOMO and a ton of wishful thinking."

2) right now they can charge a fortune for their cars cause they have a unique product and more demand than supply, AND THERE IS A TINY USED MARKET, and their net profit margin is about 12% but look 3 years down the line and Tesla is producing 3x the amount of model y than today and model y are being sold off  lease so you have 4x todays supply will Tesla have to drop prices 12% to keep sales? If yes the net profit goes to zero. Now look 5 years down the line and the used model y supply is triple todays new sales so used prices will drop- so resale drops so new car price must also drop in accordance-if it drops 12% tesla has no profit
3) right now there is a huge car shortage and all car prices have jumped 20% - but when the chip shortage stabilizes and car prices drop 20% will Tesla be forced to drop prices in accordance? 
4) looking 3-5 years down the line every major oem  will have over a million ev which is direct competition-will Tesla endless demand hold up or must they drop prices 12%?
5) when the bulls say that Tesla has higher gross margins than the rest of the auto industry they are missing a few massive points-a) true Tesla has higher gross BUT THEY HAVE HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AS WELL. They sell direct to consumer so have all the associated costs retailer costs. (I don’t know for sure but I strongly suspect that the superchargers are a loss leader!) b) they actually don’t include r&d in ‘cost of goods sold’ like other auto! If you look at other auto their OPERATING cost is like 5% but Tesla has an operating cost of like 17%
6) when it comes to robot taxi-don’t know why you think Tesla is anywhere remotely in the lead. Tesla right now in fsd  beta goes about 1 mile or so between interventions- cruise and waymo go about 200 thousand mile between interventions! That means that insurance for Tesla robotaxi  should be 200000x more expensive! Also the cruise origin only costs about 50k$ to build, is designed to go a million miles(that’s a hardware cost of 5 cents a mile), and gm is currently building a factory capable of producing hundreds of thousands a year.

Although first I’ll point out I like Tesla the company and want them to succeed as I think it’s good for the US (my country). I’m not buying one anytime soon but would consider it in 5-10 years when my 2016 car takes a crap. Our other car is a used Honda which will live forever.

Main issue is valuation. It’s one thing to say it will be the biggest automobile company to say the biggest company requires a lot more to go right or the government to break up apple, Msft, goog or amzn imo. Software is inherently easier and cheaper. All car companies will become EV companies I don’t see them dominating the entire market even if they are number 1. I’m also skeptical on how fast the transition happens. I grew up in a rural/suburb I don’t see that being full of teslas anytime soon. You mention robotaxis why would they all be teslas? Are Asian and European countries going to have a fleet of Tesla robotaxis? No Is Amazon going to have a fleet of Tesla delivery vans? Possible but probably not. It’s going to be fragmented and it’s going to take time. Another issue is I think we just hit peak automobile so there will be less cars on road and they last longer than ever which is great for consumers. It’s why the used auto market has been crazy.

You say they are the leader in FSD are they? I don’t have much to dispute you other than listening to investing/technology podcasts that have said otherwise. However, you also didn’t really support that argument either. Iv heard they have the most data but it’s mostly useless. I doubt one company just dominates there either I don’t see them so far ahead of everyone else same with battery tech.

So basically to sum it up I think they are well run, growing, car car company, but a car company nonetheless. It’s going to be competitive and to much extra success is baked into the price making the risk/reward unattractive imo"

Let's assume the economy doesn't go into recession and Tesla can manage 30% annualized growth over the next 5 years. Seems reasonable. Let's assume net margins stay at 10% which is still slightly above industry averages. Let's assume an expected 10% annualized return and a 5 year PE of 25x given Tesla by then would have gone through most of its growth phase. That would give a fair value market cap of around 310 billion. Tesla trades at 1 trillion. Now a lot of stuff could go wrong between now and 2027. PE contraction due to rising interest rates. Lower margins due to higher inflation and cost of materials. Decreased growth due to increasing competition in EV. And we already have a stock arguably 4x overvalued. You basically need 40+% annualized growth, increasing margins, and high 40x PEs to even get a market return."

Way to few models. For the everyday man you have basically one model. They need to pull an ""iPhone"" where even though everybody has the same phone it's somehow marketed as an exclusive club and in some countries/circles seen as a status symbol.

- future population more likely to live in big cities, where individual vehicles dont make as much sense logistically, financially, or environmentally.
- the issue of charging time for a vehicle is still a big one. Made worse if you need to use a public charger--if say you dont have a house with a garage where you can plug it in. Pretty common scenario in cities like nyc.
- dont hold resale value as well as ICEs. Significant problem since cars are typically the second most expensive investment someone makes after their house.

I am more bullish on self driving EVs for companies involved in delivery and/or rideshare than i am for individuals. Fuel savings for a company's fleet of vehicles will be astronomical, not to mention the savings of automating and firing all of your drivers. But in this case i would rather invest in the company using the vehicles than the one making them

As for Tesla specifically: 1) The stock is undoubtedly overvalued, 2) elon musk is too unpredictable and egotistical for me personally. I feel more comfortable investing in a tim cook style leader, and 3) the majority of tesla supporters seem to be willfully ignorant of any criticism of the company or of musk. Reminds me a lot of the crypto and nft space, which im equally as hesitant to get involved in.

Finally, my dad owns a tesla and an electric rav4 (granted both are relatively old models, so this anecdote might not be up to date). i find the tesla to be quite uncomfortable to ride in, more expensive, and in no way superior to the rav4 for an average person's needs.

They’re making crazy ideas, the kind that transform humanity and solve problems which were otherwise thought of as unsolvable, an actual reality. 

I mean… the problem of energy storage for renewable energy! That’s huge! And that’s the whole point… Tesla isn’t about cars, it’s about making renewable energy actually practical!

This affects every single aspect of human civilization, and it’s much much bigger than Apple! Tesla had the potential to grow to ridiculous amounts, and that’s only really limited by how fast factories can be built, ideas developed, and people hired.

If you have vision, if you understand the types of ideas and geniuses than can single-handedly transform the world, then you can’t bet against Tesla.

Just in the US, GM and Ford have both announced and started producing EVs the difference is Ford and GM can ramp up production capacity and with them already being  household names it will be a lot easier to push Tesla out of the auto market.

Let's face it the cyber truck is hideous. The F150 EV looks great. Let's also not forget the Ford F-150 is the most popular truck in the US. The Mustang EV has the looks and the badge, and while it falls short of several metrics of the Tesla, it is the first generation. Next year should improve upon it. GM also announced the Silverado EV. Still think it looks like crap but that's the Silverado name and the Bowtie people recognize. These are just the US manufacturers I don't even wanna think about what the Germans and Japanese automakers are going to cook up. 

Ford is also looking at building their own microchip facilities in the US to make their own silicon to ensure their supplies don't fall apart. I believe GM is doing the same. I do not see Tesla having this kind of capital to be able to do this so as shortages drag on and with the hellish world we're in currently, I think shortages will be around for the better part of the next decade. 

I love what Tesla is doing by making the EV mainstream. But at the end of the day they cannot ramp up production like Ford, GM, and the other massive players in the market. Tesla will need to go through a massive restructuring and shift the business into AI and Solar and their cars would be a tertiary product as a luxury item."

The established companies offer a more consistent and reliable build compared to Tesla. You can find many and constant examples of poor final build quality of Tesla cars. Which should not happen for a more “luxury” brand. Tesla is not competing with entry-level cars yet have build issues similar to them.

Basically you're paying for them to become larger than most of the other auto manufacturers combined.  It's not going to happen.  The legacy automakers like Ford and VW are aggressively investing in electric. I'm betting they'll catch Telsa in electric pretty quickly.  

More so I'm not fully sold on electric vehicles taking over, at least not completely. there are several problems I see that need solving: 

1. The electric grid can't handle all vehicles becoming electric, it needs major upgrades for this.  
2. The range of electric vehicles needs to improve for many drivers such as those in rural areas or those that drive longer distances occasionally to consider them (or charging needs to get much, much faster comparable to the 5 minutes it takes to pump gasoline)
3. Urban areas heavily use street parking, not ideal for overnight charging.  I've seen people install charging stations on the curb in front of their house here but these are expensive and the wiring is often stolen quickly afterwards.  
4. Cost.  You're not going mass market when your cheapest car is ~$50k.  Plus the cost to upgrade electrical boxes and install charging stations.  

Basically the market for Tesla's is upper-middle class to wealthy people who live in the inner suburbs which is fine, but thats not take over world stuff right there."

Yes, there are other EV’s on the market, but not as many and not as accessible. Once gm, Ford, and Toyota become fully electric, the vast majority of demand for Tesla will drastically drop. Supply and demand should never be forgotten. 
2. Auto-pilot ai. Before their AI day last year, everyone thought Tesla was collecting data from all of their vehicles on the road for a giant database to work with as a foundation. The reality is that is not true and they have been manually loading in single factors into their virtual test runs meaning they are actually YEARS behind what they originally marketed on AI.
3. Spacex, boring company, and solar city have no relation at all to Tesla and it’s stock price. 
4. If Musk dies, then Tesla dies with him. If the ceo of Ford dies, Ford will survive. 
5. Build quality and how Tesla treats customers. The build quality is not that good, especially for the luxury price tag. Almost everything inside the car becomes loose after 50,000 miles because the cheap glue that holds everything wears off. Also, not a fan of how Tesla can ban you from certain software features or using charging stations for whatever reason like doing repairs on your own vehicle like applying new glue to hold everything together. 
6. Employee retention. Tesla does not keep a lot of their top employees for long because they quit and move to other companies like GM, Ford, VW.

Compare it to market caps around that (mostly other tech) and the revenue pales in comparison.

I do have some reasons why I do think Coinbase is a bad investment though:

* They are the #1 American crypto exchange and now that they're public, they will be held accountable for a lot of things in the crypto industry that go wrong
* They have a [history of illegal market manipulation](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21)
* They co-mingle unsecured stablecoins like USDT and USDC with existing crypto, creating rampant inflation, so the point where nobody really knows what's real transactions and monopoly money pumps.

The irony is crypto is supposed to be de-centralized, the main advantage of that is: *No accountability*   But when you have accountable institutions like public companies, neck deep in a very ""dark"" industry, bad things will happen.  It's not a question of ""if"" but ""when"" and the timing of that, I don't think anybody can predict."
