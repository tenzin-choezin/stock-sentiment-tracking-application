Like yesterday there were crazy block deals on ITM calls shortly before close today:

https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_450729634.png

7k of calls buys all 700k shares in the float and that traded just like that in two blocks @ 3:34 today. Presumably these are getting exercised to create IOU shares.

You add up all these ITM calls from today and its more shares than in the entire float several times over. Its next level fucked up. If the S-1 effective doesn't hit anytime soon, then I'm not sure how MMs want to contain this further. Cost to borrow going exponential as well."

Sorry I’m a newbie but would like to understand how come $600 goes to 90k in a week?

Also what application does OP use?

67,wallstreetbets,$600 >93k > 40k in a week on SST. Still holding.,2.0,typmth,2022-04-08T03:32:06Z,"IBKR shows a borrow fee of 600%

float is close to 7m shares.

authorized shares is 400m and total outstanding around the 70m or so, so they can issue new shares any time.

Short interest according to NYSE as of 3/15 was 2.8m shares - cross-ref by multiple serious websites.

Anything ORTEX says is pure bullshit they make up with their 'formulas', so I only trust the official sources.

The company is dog shit.

Could it squeeze? I think the execs will take the money and run (i.e. issue shares asap) but let's hope people make money here.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Option chain is trash. Only one with serious OI is the $25 for next Friday at 10.5k, everything else is mostly under 100 OI with a few at about 500 OI. If there is sell-off to push the price under $25 every call holder will be wiped out so keep that in mind."

Are you just going to hold a contract until it expires? Are you going to hold a stock hoping that the stock will continue to gain momentum at the course of 100% a month for the rest of time? What is the thought behind holding like this?

Over 25M in premium purchased in the last 60 minutes DEEP ITM just like yesterday.  These are being exercised right away as nothing in showing up in open interest.  
That means dealers will have no choice but to purchase shares from Friday-Tuesday (in light of the t+2 delivery req) which is where the real circuit breaking moves will occur   
Today along have over 26,000 Options with strikes 40-55 expiring 04/08 (i.e. IN ONE DAY) changing hands alongside DEEP ITM 7-15 strike prices for 04/08 and 04/14 purchased and likely exercised overnight.  
Looking for a move up over 40 and for those looking for DD - a quick summary:  
723% CTB  
700K float  
480% short interest  
2.8M call contracts expiring IN THE MONEY for 04/08 and 04/14"

I needed to wait for the OI numbers this morning and had a strong feeling of what they would be give every sell off yesterday was met with MASSIVE buyside flow and they just would not let SST drop.  
  
The Open Interest numbers this morning confirmed OVER 8,000 ITM CALLS for 04/08 in strikes 7.5, 8, 9 WERE ALL BOUGHT as noted above AND EXERCISED overnight!!! That is 800000 SHARES ALONE....AGAIN!!! Same thing that has been happening ALL WEEK in the last 60 minutes of trade.  
  
That in addition to the current open interest being held in calls 40-55 strikes for both 04/08 and 04/14 expirations ARE GOING TO RESULT IN MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS TODAY as MM's cannot carry this much risk.  
  
They banked on the S1 - it did not go into EFFECT - and now the piper needs to be PAID - i.e. ""SOMEONE GIVE ME MY SHARES AFTER BEING EXERCISED"" following t+2 deliveries all week."

506,wallstreetbets,10k > 240k over night on $SST earlier this week,2.0,tyttyl,2022-04-08T11:44:07Z,"The ITM calls CONTINUE to be BOUGHT and EXERCISED in MASSIVE ORDERS  
  
I needed to wait for the OI numbers this morning and had a strong feeling of what they would be give every sell off yesterday was met with MASSIVE buyside flow and they just would not let SST drop.  
  
The Open Interest numbers this morning confirmed OVER 8,000 ITM CALLS for 04/08 in strikes 7.5, 8, 9 WERE ALL BOUGHT as noted above AND EXERCISED overnight!!! That is 800000 SHARES ALONE....AGAIN!!! Same thing that has been happening ALL WEEK in the last 60 minutes of trade.  
  
That in addition to the current open interest being held in calls 40-55 strikes for both 04/08 and 04/14 expirations ARE GOING TO RESULT IN MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS TODAY as MM's cannot carry this much risk.  
  
They banked on the S1 - it did not go into EFFECT - and now the piper needs to be PAID - i.e. ""SOMEONE GIVE ME MY SHARES AFTER BEING EXERCISED"" following t+2 deliveries all week."
