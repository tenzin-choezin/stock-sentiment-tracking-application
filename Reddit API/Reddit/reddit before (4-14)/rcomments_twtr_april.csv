65,wallstreetbets,Elon takes 9.2% stake in TWTR!,1.0,tvylmu,2022-04-04T14:32:31Z,We should have known he wasn’t building a Twitter competitor. He likes to buy businesses and pretend he started them from the ground up. Can’t wait to see him talking about how he invented Twitter in a few years.

70,wallstreetbets,Elon takes 9.2% stake in TWTR!,0.0,tvylmu,2022-04-04T12:52:07Z,"Why did Elon file a Schedule 13G instead of a 13D? [Link](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001418091/f66f56c1-eb52-43f8-a7ff-992dc80a7396.pdf)

13G is for passive stakes where there’s no plan to actively take control of the business. But Elon sounds more like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn - a pure activist focused on free speech or whatever. So maybe he should’ve filed a 13D?

This feels like it could be a quick pump and dump lol"

I share your sentiment about TWTR, it's a broken business model. It's almost impossible to advertise effectively to mostly anonymous users and the demand for Twitter Blue or Premium or whatever is pretty sparse. Elon can't fix that, at least not for a few years let alone this quarter. I would have bought a longer expiry though, it's worth the premium if you believe in your trade. This market is too erratic and short sighted to put on trades like this and expect anything but a coin flip outcome. Hope it works out homie."

298,wallstreetbets,Am I fucked..? TWTR is crap,1.0,tx7inm,2022-04-06T02:28:59Z,Just keep averaging down. Soon you can average down with a cost basis of .05 a contract.

There’s a gap fill on the daily and 47 is a pretty good target/area of support. Don’t know what your entry is or how bad time decay is gonna hit you but good luck!

423,wallstreetbets,Am I fucked..? TWTR is crap,1.0,tx7inm,2022-04-06T07:17:46Z,"What is odd for me is twitter management's statement :

“Our policy decisions are not determined by the Board or shareholders,” Zamora explained. “As always our Board plays an important advisory and feedback role across the entirety of our service. Our day to day operations and decisions are made by Twitter management and employees.”

[https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011558/twitter-elon-musk-board-members-special-exceptions-moderation-rules](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/5/23011558/twitter-elon-musk-board-members-special-exceptions-moderation-rules)

&#x200B;

Which sounds like theyre going head on with Elon. Yeah sure operationally the management executes day to day and the company plan... which... is determined by the BOD i.e people in Elon's role. 

&#x200B;

On the other hand here's how Elon do things:

To: Everybody  
From: Elon Musk  
Date: Monday October 4 \[time redacted\]  
Subj. Please Note  
  
If an email is sent from me with explicit directions, there are only three actions allowed by managers.  
  
1. Email me back to explain why what I said was incorrect. Sometimes, I’m just plain wrong!  
2. Request further clarification if what I said was ambiguous.  
3. Execute the directions.  
  
If none of the above are done, that manager will be asked to resign immediately.  
  
Thank you,  
  
Elon

&#x200B;

Which is a no BS kind of guy.

Already some twitter employees are showing their dislike of Elon's share ownership. So in the short term there might be conflict and a lot of reshuffle. It remains to be seen also how the other BOD members will work.

TLDR: Basically a lot of unknown here and I dont think your put play is that bad but 14 April man... I dunno"

30% conversion, assuming a VERY prudent 1:1 DAU to MAU rate. (daily active users = 217mm, i'm assuming 217mm monthly active users too)

217mm\*30% = 65mm users

$3 \* 65mm = $195mm a month

$195mm \* 3 = $585mm a qtr

translates to \~$2.3 billion of incremental revenue a year.

Let's say they lose $0.5b of advertising revenue a year.

$6b revenue - $0.5b + 2.3b = $7.8b of revenue, or 30% growth just with very prudent expectations on this change."

Lead the executive team at Twitter to believe he wanted a board seat, have them run a press release and announce via Twitter and then turn around a reject the seat. Stock plummets. He buys at a discount. Gives him an opportunity to purchase the whole company. Achievement unlocked."

894,wallstreetbets,Elon hostile take over $TWTR,49.0,u0yj1z,2022-04-11T03:58:00Z,The issue is over 70% of the stock is owned by mutual funds and institutions. It would have to plummet quite a bit to make them all abandon their shares to make them available for hostile takeover

the owner is going to buy back every single share and twitter goes back into private ownership. those involved in denying the rights of the owner and profitted in a major fraud/theft get to pick up the bill, thing is, it is not just twitter, other companies are also involved, robin hood is another."

73 million shares represents 3.4 billion dollars - only 1.5% of Elon's total net worth. I highly doubt that Elon bought 9% of Twitter just to then unload it for a minor profit a few weeks later. That's not his game plan. I would instead expect him to buy up massive amounts of shares in the coming weeks, initiating a hostile takeover.

What is the probability that a number repeats its predecessor in a 7 digit sequence? How about a 2 digit sequence?

Are they above or below 10%? 20%?

I'm gonna give you a hint 2 digits are about 10%.

Do you think the occurrence of repeats will happen more frequently in a 7 digit number?

1112,wallstreetbets,UPDATE - How my TWTR puts YOLO is going... still holding,6.0,tyje32,2022-04-07T18:30:34Z,"My initial post of this play:[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/twgct9/this\_morning\_i\_bought\_8k\_of\_40\_twtr\_puts\_expiring/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/twgct9/this_morning_i_bought_8k_of_40_twtr_puts_expiring/)

I bought these the morning Elon bought his stake and the price shot up. I was at a 30% loss by closing. I bought more contracts as TWTR climbed up to bring my average cost basis to just about $1.

While SPY took a dump this week, TWTR didn't swing as wildly, nor would I expect it to. But it has been falling. At its lowest point today I could have closed my puts for a 15% gain, but I'm only 3 days into a month long play so I figure I'll hold and wait."

Someone PMed me last night congratulating me on the story about Elon Musk opting not to join the Twitter Board of Directors. Don't get me wrong, I love me some volatility and Elon knows how to bring it. Chaosh ish a laddah, and all that. 

But one theory suggests that Elon declined the position because it came with a stipulation limiting his maximum ownership stake, and he intends to buy more. And that had me real nervous about my puts. 

At the lowest TWTR price point this morning, my deep OTM $40 puts were worth 1.40, compared to the .95 I paid for them. For the 100 contracts I owned that would be a $4500 or \~45% profit, quite respectable. I watched the price recover for a solid 20 minutes before finally deciding not to risk it and closing out at 1.05.   


Shortly after I bought 20 call contracts for the end of the month at $50 for $2.70 each, figuring I'd do a swing trade and sell it off at the end of the day's bounce. Naturally I ended up buying at the top of the bounce, and watched my calls decline to $2 before taking the rest of the day to recover. They are now sitting at breakeven, but the trend is upward so I'm gonna gamble and hold for at least another day."

That’s the cause of the downgrade. This wasn’t sustainable and now there isn’t much room to grow. Elon has a “to the moon” following that doesn’t care about fundamentals.

Elon has 80.5M followers and he is using twitter only main media to communicate public. 

If twitter blocks him, for some reason like Trump account, Elon is doomed. Knowing that, Elon took 9.2% to go to board at cheapest cost!

Now, twitter is his baby, everything to worldwide communication is assured.

If there is any issue, he will take more stake to 25% level, none can stand against Elon !

Elon is master minded."

The interesting question is, when has Elon ever made large investment purchases? For decades he’s been all-in on his personal companies without investing for personal wealth in other stocks. This seems unusual. Further more he typically gets extremely hands on with his projects so I would expect him to put pressure on changes at Twitter that will potentially be controversial, or great product advice and marketing that will make it fly. 

The stock might be down trending in general, but wouldn’t be surprised if we see occasional wild volatility, or ultimately a partnership or acquisition"

I think one of the agreement of this appeasement of a board seat is that Elon wont buy more than 15% of twitter. I think it is probable that Elon buy more and unseat the execs.
