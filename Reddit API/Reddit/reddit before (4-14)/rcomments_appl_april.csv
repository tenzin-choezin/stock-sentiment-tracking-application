You have to remember what a big piece of shit that was until the first iPod and iPhone. Steve reinvigorated that company. I mean it was dead weight even through the 90s and into the early 2000s. So the first option is a company that rebuilds itself into something like that. Like if intel just magically got their act together or who knows? So that's option one the second one is some disruptive business. People are looking at EV charging stations as a potential boom cycle but I kind of wonder how much growth and valuation you can really put in a gas station? I don't think we really have any clear leadership yet because we don't even know what the leadership sector is going to be for the next bull market. Right now it's commodities, but commodity cycles never last that long. I think 2005 to 2008 was probably one of the longer ones"

I hate to admit it, but possibly that's virtual reality stuff.  Maybe they get over their hurdles of being an expensive geek toy, and take over the world, like computers did.  Trouble is computers started out being useful, and then became a toy.  What started as a toy and became useful?  Phones maybe?

Trouble with investing in this space is Meta is just a hard nope.    Their hugeness and their history, mean it won't be them, they had their time in the son, and made a mess of it.

MSFT is kind of a secret player here.  Could be what they were thinking when buying Activision.  They have branded goggles.  They have Teams.   They have a gaming ecosystem.  They are well positioned, but, they are big name, last wave's news.     Same with AAPL, like they made pocket computers cool, and desperately need something new to continue to justify their price.  If anyone can bring this stuff to the masses, it's them.  This next thing though is already priced in, everyone has AAPL because they think AAPL is going to do something cool again, like with the Mac and then the iPhone.


What you'd want though, which I don't see or know about, is the scrappy little company that hasn't made it yet that becomes the dominant player in this space, like TSLA or Spotify did.     That might be the next thing to watch for.  On the other hand, has that company already been bought by a big player?   Has the world changed so we don't get a new whatever, it's at best the brand of a big player?

As for something else, I wish I knew.  What's the problem that needs to be solved, and who's solving it in some clever way?"

They‚Äôve developed AI for self driving cars, have used machine learning to automate a lot of tasks developers, engineers and designers would normally have to do manually. 

The other day, I realized I could use the NVIDIA AI to reduce noise in my microphone, as well as upscale the resolution of games. While these are small applications that won‚Äôt convince most investors, NVIDIA has pivoted in recent years to completely embrace artificial intelligence and deep learning and are moving the company in that direction. Once self driving cars, automated traffic and smart factories become the norm, you can expect NVIDIA to be even more of a juggernaut in the tech industry."

There are already batteries in existence that can allow a Tesla to go over 750 miles on a single charge. Why hasn't Tesla implemented these? Longer charge times and faster degradation. The ""longest range"" batteries require materials that only last for a few recharge cycles so putting them in a Tesla would mean the car would only last a couple years before the battery was completely wiped out. NIO will never have that problem. They will always be able to use the latest and greatest battery technology - even if that means single-use batteries (which do exist btw) that have some crazy 2500 mile range. Tesla does not have that flexibility. Tesla has to worry about how many recharge cycles the battery can withstand without significant degradation and so they are forced to forgo certain battery configurations that would allow them to achieve 750 mile range. Legacy automakers like Ford and GM are not researching battery swap tech because they believe that is not what the market wants, because the market leader (Tesla) says so. Everyone is just following Papa Elon's lead like he's Einstein. Newsflash: Even Einstein was wrong sometimes. The fact that the whole industry is blindly playing follow the leader should tell you something.

Also, Tesla's P/S is about 30x, while NIO's P/S is less than 10x even though Tesla is a megacap company and NIO is only $25B (normally, growth stage companies have much higher P/S because their sales are expect to ""grow"" while larger companies have lower P/S because their sales are approaching maturity)..

In the next 5 years, NIO is going to flood the US market with premium quality low cost EVs and everyone's going to say ""I missed NIO but at least I didn't invest in Tesla"""

1) <$20 billion market cap

Next, what are the financial qualities of a ""decade"" stock? Revenue growth. This is tricky though since COVID skewed results both up and down but you will still have many companies. 

2) 5 year annual revenue growth >20%

Good balance sheet. None of the companies mentioned in the original thread ever had any material debt.

3) Debt/MktCap < .2

It is hard to get the list much smaller with quantitative measures without eliminating potential contenders.

I'm quite interested in know how big of role their enterprise branch is. 

Anyone has insights to this? I mean, their quadro lineup is not exactly cheap and most servers requires more GPU than what a typical consumer grade computer would have. Furthermore, I'm pretty sure they have dwellings / collaborations specifically in the enterprise sectors."
909,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,7.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T04:10:56Z,"I'm long all 3 stocks and QQQ. Here are my thoughts. 

* NVDA currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 83.4 times
* AMD trades at a P/E of 40
* Intel trades at a P/E of 10.6

>The [P/E ratio](https://investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20the%20P%2FE,is%20low%20relative%20to%20earnings) helps investors determine the market value of a stock as compared to the company's earnings. In short, the P/E ratio shows what the market is willing to pay today for a stock based on its past or future earnings. A high P/E could mean that a stock's price is high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current stock price is low relative to earnings.

In my personal view, NVDA is an awesome company, but everyone knows that already, and it is priced in, meaning if you are buying NVDA, you must think it is going to do even better than everyone already thinks it will do (this is a very high bar). I would look to add around $200-$220. 

AMD is a similar story. I would look to add at $90-$100. 

I like Intel. I think it has the most surprise upside potential. If the situation with Russia/China gets worse, Intel would be in the best position because of their domestic & European manufacturing capability. I would look to add at $45."
910,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,3.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T00:16:13Z,AAPL because chips are quite risky right now in my opinion. You can probably get in chips at a substantially lower price.

The same to AAPL, down the cost. If a person can only buy one stock that must be AAPL. How could one build his/her portfolio without the greatest company? AAPL has stable ecosystem of products, huge growth potential of service business which would increase gross margin. Its free cash flow yield keeps growing and ROE is 140% in 2021 whereas Samsun has only 17%"
918,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,2.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T14:25:04Z,"I think AAPL is the most overvalued. Sure they're growing rapidly right now but their products are are expensive and discretionary, so if the economy slows they will suffer the most. Also heavy exposure to potential Taiwan conflicts. Everyone thinks AAPL is super safe, and that alone makes it unsafe.  

AMD is the best price for its growth in my opinion. But it's at 40 p/e... you might get it at 30 p/e in the next 12 months. Still AMD has a lot of exposure to consumer PC markets. It's more discretionary than NVDA.  

NVDA is just too expensive, in my opinion because of the metaverse hype, but we are seeing the valuations contract. Maybe you get it at 40 p/e soon."

920,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,2.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T16:35:40Z,"As someone who‚Äôs been watching all 3 recently, here‚Äôs my take on what will happen.

1. Apple - at a near ATH (less than 7% off), which is similar to S&P500. Heck, they were at ATH just last week. I find the growth in Apple to be in short spurts. It tends to boom up, then trade sideways for a while. I think we‚Äôre gonna go sideways for a bit with Apple, especially with general market weakness. While Apple is a great company, its had a hell of a boom recently (tripled in value over last 2 years). Long term, it will go up I‚Äôm sure. But I might trade sideways for a while before then.

2. NVDA - Quite a bit off their ATH currently, but also not quite at their bottom I don‚Äôt think. I could see them going to 200, maybe a bit less with poor market stability. Their P/E is still incredibly optimistic compared to the rest of the field. In order to maintain their P/E over the next two years, they‚Äôd grow 50%. It holds a high PEG value too, (2.92), meaning it is relatively overvalued even accounting for its growth. I think it definitely can go up, but I think it‚Äôs actually pretty fairly priced where it‚Äôs at. 

3. AMD has taken a brutal beating recently. It‚Äôs about 60% off it‚Äôs ATH. It would need to increase 50% y/y to match its projected growth by 2024. Its PEG ratio is under 1, indicating it‚Äôs a buy. AMD is currently sitting at a 6 month low. It hasn‚Äôt been valued lower than 100 per share since July 2021. Since this valuation, which is before Semi‚Äôs really took off in Q4, AMD has acquired Xilinx, acquired another (albeit smaller) company, announced a 8bil buyback while completing nearly 3 billion of their last announcement. What this tells me, is that AMD is so confident in their company and they think they‚Äôre undervalued, so they‚Äôre buying up their own stock with free cash to potentially resell later or improve valuation.

Of these 3, the greatest short play is AMD. It has the highest opportunity to increase 50% y/y. Next would be NVIDIA. Ideal growth at 25% y/y. Finally Apple, which I would be impressed with a growth rate of 15% y/y.

I think the riskiest play, at this point, is actually NVIDIA. They‚Äôve been really overvalued for a long time, despite their market dominance. With greater market competition, they may struggle in the years to come. AMD is in the same boat, but just more undervalued across the board, and therefore has less room to fall. Apple is by far the safest play, I would say. But that doesn‚Äôt mean a 20% drop couldn‚Äôt happen over the next few months.

Disclaimer: I hold substantial amounts of all three stocks listed for close to two years now. My biggest position is in AMD, for the reasons I listed."

938,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T05:28:50Z,Yes.
939,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T06:03:41Z,AMD.
940,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:02:32Z,"I love all 3 so this is a great question. NVDA great verticals, sitting on a ton of cash, I can see them making a big move since ARM deal didn't go through, they will definitely buy something else. If they raise cash from creation of new shares (rumor currently) I believe this is confirmation that they will do something huge with the money. Sure they are trading at a high multiple but winners are expensive and NVDA is the industry leader.

AAPL the obvious question is how much bigger can they get but great products and could they be developing software for vehicles and partner with an auto maker? Probably the safest out of these 3."
941,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:04:15Z,I like Apple. Video card prices are dropping and Nvidia is between releases with their 4000 series RTX cards. Apple just prints money with their walled garden
942,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:09:44Z,AMD is the most reasonably priced but all above where I'd be comfortable buying.

944,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:41:17Z,All 3
945,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T07:43:20Z,AMD > NVIDIA > APPLE as everyone has said already. I have about 300k INR in AMD currently.
946,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T08:59:55Z,AAPL
947,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T09:13:17Z,I‚Äôd hold off as markets going to drop a bit more IMO. I‚Äôd buy SOXL which is currently $28.29 (might drop to $25 or lower in next few weeks). Ride it up to $35+ then sell then buy AMD which should be below $95. SOXL isn‚Äôt a buy and hold but but can salvage a portfolio quickly during a recovery like we just had.
948,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,1.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T09:23:23Z,"Personally I would say all three are overvalued at current prices (Nvidia>Apple>AMD). I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll necessarily lose money on any of these long term but it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll beat the index.

Intel sub-50 seems a better bet to me."

964,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,0.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T02:52:14Z,"Personally I'd say not apple, they have a lot of shitty business practices and laws in the EU and in other areas are taking aim at them. Nvidia is an extremely powerful and diverse company. AMD is a very powerful company but only at CPUs and GPUs. Personally I'd recommend Intel, they're a direct competitor to AMD, their products hold a similar quality and price point, and they pay out a dividends while still having decent growth."
965,stocks,Apple or AMD or Nvidia,0.0,tzzr6q,2022-04-10T04:43:09Z,"I haven't read other comments, but AMD for sure. EXTREMELY undervalued still at 100. They are better than Intel and nVidia, PC gamers/builds are on the rise. 

I bought a decent amount at 75 and Rick I bought more then. But have bought more at 95. They are still extremely undervalued at 100 IMO."

That‚Äôs why awhile back the Hyundai alleged partnership was so intriguing.

I like the idea of it until I start thinking about what it might be‚Ä¶ 

Apple is never first to a market, they enter only if they can dramatically improve it. They also avoid markets where there are thin margins, even at volume. So they‚Äôd basically be in the same place as Tesla except that‚Äôs what every other manufacturer is doing now too. The car with an iPad in the dash isn‚Äôt new or revolutionary. 

The only benefit in fact would be that the ability to go beyond the thing Tesla did with calendar sync and FSD driving you to your next appointment/destination automatically. That deeper integration would be theoretically awesome, but then is there a webcam in the mirror so I can zoom while driving? Because I won‚Äôt lie I kinda want that mobile office, but it‚Äôs also a dumb idea for safety and distraction reasons. In fact if I‚Äôm driving I shouldn‚Äôt be using a touch screen much of looking at a screen share instead of the road. So if it isn‚Äôt a mobile office/Mac/iPad on wheels what is it? Is it a HomePod on wheels? What‚Äôs the revolutionary user interface so key to so many of Apples successes? Self driving? Siri driving? Joystick steering like an Airbus?

1115,investing,Is 50/50 Tesla Apple a bad investment?,2.0,u1bo92,2022-04-11T17:58:22Z,"Investing that narrowly is incredibly risky. Let's say Musk is banned from serving as CEO or on the board of a publicly traded company because he commits securities fraud again, and their margins dive as other manufacturers roll out EVs over the next decade.  In that situation, your Tesla shares are going to tank, as they're priced for tremendous growth.  It's one thing when it's a few percentage points in an index.  It's another when it's 50% of your portfolio.

On the flip side, you're concentrated.  Let's say everything Tesla is involved in does super well, and the most optimistic bulls have their dreams surpassed.  Robotaxis arrive in force, Tesla makes every other vehicle on the road, their storage business booms, etc.  You will outperform.

Are you fine with that concentration being at risk.  Personally, I think Tesla being overvalued is the much more likely case, but I know many disagree.  At the end of the day, I would rather be incredibly likely to have decent returns through a broad, diversified portfolio, rather than risk everything on 2 companies."

Just invest in a broad market index fund.  I particularly dislike Tesla, not so much based on their business but the stock is incredibly over-valued.

1123,investing,Is 50/50 Tesla Apple a bad investment?,1.0,u1bo92,2022-04-11T22:31:38Z,"If you have 250, I'd look into doing slices, currently I'd be verrrrrry cautious of what/who you decide to give your money to. I do think Tesla is a solid bet in the long run.

They have so many potential plays, and industry partners during times of strife famously the government does necessary infrastructure.

Going all into a singular companies stock might be a wee bit inadvisable right now unless you have a realllly strong stomach and conviction to continur buying as it goes lower. Like no doubt in your mind, and also doesn't hurt to know an all up health check of a company's total market share of whatever it was.

If I were to be in your shoes, I would likely invest heavily in buffet, and then give a little to elon to gain risk exposure.
Just in case it didn't occur to anyone, he owns space critica infrastructure, space charging, ground charging, autonomous vehicles, privatized satellite comms, dynamicsly stable unbalanced autonomous rocket navigation.

But he's a wee bit of a wild card, and the public association of him with the hobnobbery of silicon valley tech is too strong, however he departed a long while ago.

Just my 2 cents. Not an investment advisor, nor remotely qualified to give advice. I'm just an engineer and self styled value investor.

Also be cautious of just tossing your money into an index fund, or etf, or any investment vehicle where you have less visibility into how it operates. M. Burry thinks ETFs and Index Funds are saturated, and having done a review I'm inclined to think so as well.

AAPL is basically a safe store of wealth and will do about as well or better than the S&P whereas TSLA still has room to 5x within a couple years. So it‚Äôs pretty balanced if you‚Äôre a tech investor. 

However the trouble with being invested in TSLA is that it‚Äôs better not to tell anyone, watch this get downvoted to shit and someone to get in my replies and argue why Tesla is a scam and I‚Äôm an idiot."

Clearly Ryan Cohen was letting us know it was his birthday on March 2nd. On March 7th he moved the earnings report to the 17th, which is his dad's birthday.


The apple didn't fall far from the tree. March 2nd isn't far from March 17th. It's so obvious. You're all fools! Fools I say!



(Also my birthday is in March and my mom's birthday is 5 days after mine in the month, so I'm kinda like RC.)


Edit: and another thing! 2, 7, 17.. reverse those (whole) numbers and you have 1772. What happened in 1772, you ask?

What I have found is that often the platform itself is poorly maintained while allowing content creators and artists to populate content to draw in customers.

What people don't realize is that the creators and artists creating the content for the platforms are often underpaid and work incredibly hard to get somewhere. With the exception of the few that basically take the data the receive from their sales to artificially create content that then targets trends specifically to get as much money as possible. 

Because to make money when you're already funneling money yourself to get access to those customers you are now losing more money than the company that owns the platform. 

You are essentially helping somebody else get rich by using their platform to reach customers for your own audience. 

If NFTs are used as ways to protect content and to ensure that creators are paid, without scalping money from the artist and creators themselves. That would be game changing by cutting out the platform middle man.

Because at the end of the day predatory platforms either suck the creative life and ability out of artists and creators or the financial burden that the platform places upon their artists and creators is then pushed onto the customers. 

There's nothing really game-changing about these platforms that essentially funnel as much money from every end well as doing as little work to support them. 

We see this with Amazon, YouTube, Etsy etc. Time and time again.

Etsy forces creators to include shipping in the cost of the product, so that it appears to have free shipping. They also target high selling specific items via algorithm to then place advertisements throughout their pages. When they Make a sale because of this ad they take a chunk of money from that sale. So unsuspecting customers click seeing a promoted item because of their algorithms but don't realize that they are literally giving Etsy the money that should have gone to the small business owner. 

It's incredibly predatory these types of behaviors or lack of involvement in creating stable safe platforms all for the sake of taking as much money as possible.

Meta vs will be no different."

‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Apes with money tied up in other investments could convert those to GME and DRS.

‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Apes with shares in brokers that will not DRS, such as Etoro and T212 : think about selling and re-buying elsewhere!! They don‚Äôt have shares anyway, so selling hurts nothing. Don‚Äôt trust your millions to a broker that won‚Äôt transfer. Just read their TOS!"

1525,Superstonk,MetaMask announces integration with Apple Pay (perhaps GameStop wallet is next?),1.0,twvd9q,2022-04-05T13:56:25Z,"Article:

""It became known that the popular cryptocurrency wallet MetaMask intends to expand the list of services and opportunities for its customers. In particular, the statement says that the developers intend to add the integration of the Apple Pay payment gateway. This will diversify the list of supported methods for purchasing digital assets for Apple gadgets holders.

Based on the statement that appeared on the official MetaMask Twitter account, thanks to these innovations, iPhone users will finally be able to start buying cryptocurrency almost directly. That is, gadget holders will be able to purchase digital assets through credit and debit cards linked to their Apple Pay accounts.

Among other things, in a press release from ConsenSys, which owns the crypto wallet, it is said that thanks to such a large-scale update, users of the MetaMask application will be able to buy digital assets not only for dollars and euros but also for 68 more fiat currencies.

‚ÄúThis is a breakthrough. We have been working for a long time to improve and simplify the process of buying cryptocurrencies for our customers. Our new partnership will enable millions of Apple users to purchase virtual currencies in the fastest and most secure way.""

The statement also indicates which cryptocurrencies citizens will be able to start buying through Apple Pay very soon. According to official data, through Mastercard cards, users will be able to purchase the second-largest cryptocurrency by capitalization - ETH. The developers focused on the fact that at the beginning there will be some restrictions - in one day it will be possible to buy ether for an amount not exceeding $400. In the future, it is specified in the statement, the limit can be significantly increased.

In addition to Ethereum, the press release says, it will be possible to purchase several popular stablecoins using cards linked to Apple Pay. We are talking about Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and Dai (DAI). It is known from the MetaMask message that the number of commissions when buying coins will depend on the payment method and the location (country) of each specific user."""
