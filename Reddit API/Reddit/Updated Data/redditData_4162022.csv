1592,tsla,wallstreetbets,POST,$TSLA and $TWTR and TSLA earnings - Hear me out here,"So earnings are coming up this week for TSLA.. Elon Musk's entire net worth is really in the stock of his companies (TSLA and Space X)...

The offer to buy out Twitter can only happen if 1 of 2 things happens:

* Elon Musk sells his stock in TSLA (and owns less of TSLA going forward); or
* Elon Musk uses his stock as collateral to leverage some massive level debt in order to buy Twatter.

Lets assume he uses his TSLA stock as leverage... I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122. They probably got a peak, were happy with what they saw and were good with him putting an offer forward for the 43 billy for Twatter because the stock (what he'll use for collateral) will continue to rise in value going forward PRIOR to Q122 earnings date.

Am I reading too much into this and going full tard or am I making sense? Are my TSLA 1050 5/20 calls going to print?",1.0,u55db3,2022-04-16T19:35:11Z,2022-04-16

1596,tsla,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,$TSLA and $TWTR and TSLA earnings - Hear me out here,"Elon Musk would need about $15B in cash or debt to close a transaction without any outside investors. Morgan Stanley has already soft circled more than that in debt secured by Musk's SpaceX and Tesla stock. This is how it breaks down: 

**Assumptions:**

$   43B Purchase Price  
$     4B Value of Shares Elon Owns  
$   24B Collateral value of Twitter (assuming GS 12-month price target of $30/share)

$ 15B CASH and/or DEBT Needed

**Elon's Assets:**

$   50B SpaceX Stock   
$ 200B Telsa Stock  
$      3B Cash

**Outside Investors:**

$      6B Blackrock, Morgan Stanley, and SilverLake have all hinted they would like to stay in a private-owned Twitter if Elon takes it private. 

I am not confident that a deal will go through, but I am very confident that Elon has access to enough capital to close a transaction if he can get something done.",6.0,u55db3,2022-04-16T19:55:09Z,2022-04-16

2. They will not find a better deal.
3. They will get sued by shareholders.
4. Twitter will be forced to sell Twitter to Musk for a lower per-share offering; Hypothetical: $42.20
5. The money that Musk originally offered to buy Twitter will be used to cover legal expenses that he now has to fix because of shareholder lawsuits for Twitter not taking the original $54.20 per share offer.
6. Your point is good that he will use TSLA as leverage somehow.

Conspiracy Theory: Musk uses some of the original cash offerings to buy back shares to make shareholders happy for the sole reason of judges throwing out lawsuits. I have no idea what I'm talking about.",3.0,u55db3,2022-04-16T20:23:57Z,2022-04-16

I may update this in the future. Thank you to anyone I forgot to mention that had also discussed Aladdin but forgot to credit.

Quick update
For the record I am not a software or networking guy and even though I tried to learn more about their system with the University video provided I would rather defer to apes who specialize in that. This is probably nothing but still felt it was worth taking a chance brining attention to it.

7162,gme,Superstonk,POST,"GME Floor website hits $100,000,000 on DFV day? Probably nothing.","However, the price still needs 1 more digit to be a standard US phone number, and 4 more digits after that to encapsulate the largest country code/region code (44-XXX is the country code for Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man - I’m leaving out 44 as that is the UK code). 

Then obviously I have to double that to account for taxes. That’s $20,000,000,000,000 (20 trillion) dollars. So we are at 0.000005% of that today. 

According to the global economy value infographic, the total value of the global economy (including derivatives) is $4,200,000,000,000,000 (4.2 quadrillion). 

$20 trillion is ~0.0048% of $4.2 quadrillion. 

If my math is right, which is doubtful, the entire global economy (including derivatives) is worth a whopping 210 shares of GME.

7361,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,TWTR Poison Pill? Buy the Dip - an alternative viewpoint based on Naked Short Selling.,"A lot of posts are developing on WSB that TWTR Puts is a play. I believe the opposite is True.

My Reasoning: The US Stock Market is driven by **unregulated Naked Short selling** and tech companies are a prime target for price control and pinning. Aside from Insider Trading, these two forces should be used to determine price movement post announcement.

&#x200B;

# ASSUMING NAKED SHORT SELLING IS A MARKET FORCE:

For TWTR's 50% discount Poison Pill - the effect is simple, naked short sellers need to buy shares at market, or increase their leverage to provide additional shares to buyers, or ~~close~~ cover their naked short positions.

This move **kills 3 birdies with one stone:**

1. It prevents TWTR from hostile take over.
2. Increases share price.

7363,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,TWTR Poison Pill? Buy the Dip - an alternative viewpoint based on Naked Short Selling.,"A poison pill isn't a stock dividend, it's the dilution of your stock to avoid a hostile takeover.

Even if naked short selling is something that drives the market (which in itself is highly questionable/debatable), please explain to me how Twitter diluting their own shares would hurt naked short sellers?

The argument for puts is that the poison pill being triggered, or even the threat of the poison pill, will likely drive the stock price of Twitter down.

The argument against puts is that Elon raises his offer (which he clearly stated he won't do in his initial offer), or some outside group gives a rival bid higher than Elons initial bid.

I just genuinely don't understand the rationale of your argument to go long on Twitter due to the poison pill because of supposed naked short selling. 

If I'm missing something obvious, please enlighten me.",15.0,u56s0v,2022-04-16T21:09:27Z,2022-04-16

7400,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,$TSLA and $TWTR and TSLA earnings - Hear me out here,"So earnings are coming up this week for TSLA.. Elon Musk's entire net worth is really in the stock of his companies (TSLA and Space X)...

The offer to buy out Twitter can only happen if 1 of 2 things happens:

* Elon Musk sells his stock in TSLA (and owns less of TSLA going forward); or
* Elon Musk uses his stock as collateral to leverage some massive level debt in order to buy Twatter.

Lets assume he uses his TSLA stock as leverage... I don't think a bank would give Elon Musk a loan for that much money without knowing how TSLA did during Q122. They probably got a peak, were happy with what they saw and were good with him putting an offer forward for the 43 billy for Twatter because the stock (what he'll use for collateral) will continue to rise in value going forward PRIOR to Q122 earnings date.

Am I reading too much into this and going full tard or am I making sense? Are my TSLA 1050 5/20 calls going to print?",1.0,u55db3,2022-04-16T19:35:11Z,2022-04-16

7446,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,A Guide To Help You Understand How Fucked Twitter Is - $TWTR,"**Not financial advice**

Ok so I know a lot of you have been following my Twitter Hindenburg posts

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tztelv/twitter\_is\_the\_hindenburg\_elon\_is\_the\_flame\_you/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tztelv/twitter_is_the_hindenburg_elon_is_the_flame_you/)

So now after reading the first post about how bad the fundamentals are and the second about how bad it would be for twitter

Now that we've gotten two updates

# First is

Elon made a tender offer then was essentially rejected

Twitter's board voted unanimously in favor of the poison pill option

What does this mean?

>Such plans allow existing shareholders the right to purchase additional shares at a discount, effectively diluting the ownership interest of any new, hostile party  
>

>Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock would enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other means.

My understanding is they can either dilute the stock by offering themselves a discount on 200M shares per enactment

Or there is disproportionate dilution (the bigger your holding the faster up your ownership% goes, the smaller the faster % down it goes)

Yes this means it's impossible for Elon to buy Twitter or retail because you will be diluted into the abyss

This is a **death spiral on a poison pill enactment** .. if Elon backs out it could crash the price and more hostile take over worries ensue.

But it gets even better

# Second update

Musk is looking to team up with other people to buy 14.9% to not trigger the current pill

TWTR planned for this

You'll notice a lot of companies have more shares at least (2:1) authorized compared to outstanding, this is going **scorched Earth** to prevent a take over

Twitter was really scared of this possibility, so they have authorized 6:1 (3 times higher than a normal contingency) just in case it seems

Edit: another commenter said this

>  
>You fucks really act like corporate lawyers haven’t spent their entire careers in m&a and with 40 years of poison pills to be worked around that easily lmao.

&#x200B;

Yes that means that if Elon goes that route Twitter is prepared to **self immolate**

This is going to get juicy

You think the SEC and DOJ are going to help retail investors?

They are already going after Musk

The MSM and bagholders etc. are posting memes about you buying it up and handing it over

That makes zero sense and it's a grift.

&#x200B;

Touch twitter if you think there's a small chance another 'dark' entity swoops in and Twitter lets them buyout to save this PR nightmare

Otherwise June 20p are looking hella spicy

Tell your friends how the death spiral mechanics work

# The Death Spiral

The timing is anyone's guess , but more importantly this conversation about it is evolving quickly and retail and the public is understanding the risks and outcomes more quickly everyday. **Long  Holiday Weekend ahahah**

This could cause share price panic to ensue which crashes prices which may accelerate take over worries resulting in near term drastic actions to oust Elon via dilution at all costs

This creates a positive feedback cycle crashing the price and diluting it more

Requiring reverse splits just to stay listed with the amount of shares being dumped from dilution MMs and emergency meetings... a short seller paradise. Regsho exempt naked short selling with the promise to return on issuance

TWTR is really about to start trading a like a fat cap penny stock

We see this a lot on tickers too small for this sub

You get to witness something special here to today

# TL;DR

Twitter gets diluted infinitely to avoid take over

Retail is getting griftied because they don't understand

Jun 20p and small size incase some mysterious buyout offer comes from TWTR buddies

&#x200B;

Questions:

Can you go into further detail on disproportional dilution? I can’t find anything that’s not super complicated (sorry am noob). Who decided where that’s at and what that’s going to be?

Can you explain authorized:outstanding and where I might find that for random companies I look up on a day to day? I’m assuming it’s the 10k?

My read based on context is that for every current share on the market Twitter is ready to print 6, 200M at a time? (Poison Pill indeed!)

The Par Value has me confused ([reading up on it](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parvalue.asp)) - so they *sell them* to shareholders at $0.000005 but they’re worth current price? So it’s like free money to incentivize everyone to buy? No one is giving their money *too* Twitter?

This is spicy stuff and I appreciate your work. I’ve been reading a bunch of different things but it’s posts/comments like this that really show me where to look and what I’m missing.",8.0,u4lznp,2022-04-16T03:07:19Z,2022-04-16

7499,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,A Guide To Help You Understand How Fucked Twitter Is - $TWTR,"This is my take on Twitter since I only just began using it a year ago. I really didn't want to, but to see what some investors were saying I decided to give it a chance.

My first impression, right out of the gate was this is so trash. The user interface is garbage and felt awkward to use. Randomly suggested people to me whose opinions I give zero fucks about. Even the people I follow, the way to view new posts take forever and navigating the app is trash.

Just my 2 cents, but if Elon were to create his own social media with a better interface with free and subscription based services like he planned on with Twitter, I bet it would take off. Free speech is valuable. This would crash Twitter a lot faster than trying to take it over or working with a scummy power hungry board. It will just end up like Myspace if a better product comes out.

Elon can just do what he's best at. Innovate and create a far superior product.",12.0,u4lznp,2022-04-16T02:35:27Z,2022-04-16

3. Afterwards, you can buy puts if you think this counteroffer will fail too and that Musk ultimately becomes disinterested.

I think OP is kind of retarded if he thinks the board will intentionally sabotage their company via mass dilution out of spite.

The truth is that Elon made a lowball offer, and I believe Elon feels this way too. He might have intentionally made this lowball offer because it publicly gets him an easy out on selling his investments at a gain (essentially a pump and dump). Or maybe he did this as part of some 3D chess move that ultimately leads to Twitter being acquired. But I am too retarded to understand what potential 3D moves there are to be made.

D-Day dilution inbound for TWTR!,"Note that although poison pill sounds bad for shareholders, it actually does not necessarily will deflate the stock price. Remember the world is not static and different actors will react to the poison pill plan. Remember dilution only happens if the triggering event happens. And the whole point of adopting the poison pill plan in the first place is so that the harmful effect of dilution will only affect the triggering party, ie. the activist investors, while sparing all other investors.

Netflix adopted a poison pill plan on Nov. 2, 2012 in response to Icahn's potential hostile bid. Its stock price subsequently rallied as much as 20% within days.

You have a very poor understanding of how these poison pill strategies work. Do not do anything this round and simply observe.",11.0,u4jmgt,2022-04-16T00:50:47Z,2022-04-16

8587,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,Timing a Recession? [$SPY - Predictions for the week of 4/18],"This is a prediction for the next 5 days except I will be talking about the timing of a recession further down.  

&#x200B;

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/rl9ahoicext81.png?width=1479&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bedba763123e9d4535cfaf5275c00ba57bcbd60)

\~432 Support

\~452 Resistance

RSI is showing a strong oversold reading, this downtrend will most likely not continue in the near term.

[1 Day Chart](https://preview.redd.it/nbare8b2hxt81.png?width=1480&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3cd58a26ceff9caadf6399d615a5aa5704c2b8)

The Bollinger bands are showing we are entering a period of lower volume and lower volatility.  I don't think we will see any major run up or down, in the next weeks (Unless there is major news).

&#x200B;

[10 Year Yield Correlation with Market Events](https://preview.redd.it/ovt5604mlxt81.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5bd6da40a63d7cb1c96b42ef9f53b24719af37)

So, back to timing a recession, this chart has gotten me very interested.  You don't need a Bloomberg terminal to do this analysis though, I realized there are many problems with using this as an indication.

&#x200B;

[30 Year Yields Compared to SPX](https://preview.redd.it/x7ljsn94mxt81.png?width=1474&format=png&auto=webp&s=53cbd12a0211926027298578d34e6cac326244d7)

Last week I said that the 30-year yields are better at predicting a market top.  Then I noticed, that both have margins of error, so finding the average of the 30Y + 10Y would be an even better indicator.  Also as the bond yields approach 0 they will decrease slower.  This is slightly an exponential trend, not a linear trend which can be fixed by graphing it logarithmically.

 

[Average of 10 Year and 30 Year Yields](https://preview.redd.it/xb0ov8ljyxt81.png?width=1477&format=png&auto=webp&s=d926fc6f86b3307182dd4f7c63aa3e3eba866aa6)

As a continuation of the current uptrend in bond yields, I would expect the yields to cross this major level around the middle of June.

This has predicted the top within about 5 months, exception of '94 though.

From this, I can conclude that when we have some recession in the next year, the central bank is just going to print more money and devalue our currency.  This is not a crisis though, no need to keep gold bars under your bed.  Maybe in another 30 years, it will be time to buy gold bars.  I just hope JPOW does not get too crazy and go to negative rates.

**Predictions**

I am not expecting any major moves in the market this week.  The stock market will most likely be fine until June.  I will look back at this in May though.  

Jerome Powell will talk Thursday at 1 pm, he may talk about reducing the balance sheet.  I don't think he will say anything crazy though, they are trying to keep the economy as stable as they can.  

Next Week I am just expecting a general uptrend in the overall market.  I will be looking for opportunities not just opening trades to have open positions.  It's very important to find asymmetric trades not FOMOing into OTM options. 

There is nothing crazy this week...

 \* Not professional financial advice, do not solely make your trades based on my opinions, I encourage everyone to research more 

**Forecast**

(Remember the 5-day outlook is the least serious part of my analysis, it is extremely hard to predict which days will be red or green)

Vertical integration to keep costs down, similar to what car manufacturers do building a common platform.

Love see windows go ARM given the many advantages. There is even a ARM version of Windows. However will take a lot time and money for transition, not only CPU manufacturers but more legacy software companies not wanting to spend more money to transition.
