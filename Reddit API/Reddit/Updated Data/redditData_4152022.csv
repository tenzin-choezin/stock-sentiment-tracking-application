Key takeaway: Under the Rights Plan, the **rights will become exercisable if an entity, person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of Twitter's outstanding common stock in a transaction not approved by the Board**. In the event that the rights become exercisable due to the triggering ownership threshold being crossed, **each right will entitle its holder (other than the person, entity or group triggering the Rights Plan, whose rights will become void and will not be exercisable) to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, additional shares of common stock having a then-current market value of twice the exercise price of the right.** 

1️⃣Elon walks away from his offer? Stonk goes down.

2. Then tender for the whole thing at $69.420. They would have to put that to vote. OR - he can trigger the poison pill. Call their bluff. They flood the market with shares. Wouldn't current holders want to short if they have a right to buy at $22.50? Whole thing backfires.

7649,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,Lawyers representing Twitter shareholders are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. The investment bank predicted that TWTR shares would continue to decline in value over the next 12 months. After the board hired Goldman to advise them they are claiming Elon's offer is way too low!,"When the Twitter shareholder lawsuits begin the class action lawyers are going to have a field day with Goldman Sachs. Just two months ago [Goldman's Equity Research](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1514726980909948928) team predicted that Twitter's share price would decline from $37.83 to $30.00 over the next twelves months and recommended their clients SELL the stock. This week Twitter's board hired Goldman Sachs to advise the board on Elon's $54.20 offer. Goldman is now [claiming](https://www.unseenopp.com/goldman-advisors-say-no-deal-to-musks-twitter-bid/) that Elon's offer was ""***too low to be taken seriously***"" despite that it is 81~~57~~% higher than their own price target for the stock. To be clear, I am not saying that GS will face any liability for their conflicting opinions but when the shareholder lawsuits come the lawyers will have a 'field day' deposing the research group and the advisory group. I am sure they will have lots of excuses - but they ever get in front of a jury it will be fun. I didn't realize how upset so many people would get by pointing this contradiction out.

There are “Chinese walls” between both departments for ethical and regulatory reasons. This is the way for ALL investment banks with equity research/brokerage functions. 

Why? Think of it this way: the investment banking division works with material, nonpublic information all day long. IPOs and upcoming M&As are the very definition of material nonpublic information. The brokerage cannot know about that before the rest of the public. In fact, the brokers/equity analysts shouldn’t talk to the investment bankers at all – especially in a work context. If they do, and they write about what they learned, they can be sanctioned by the SEC. 

Another way of looking at it is you wouldn’t want Goldman research to just shill their investment banking deals – they should provide investors with independent advice that will make them money. 

It looks bad, but that’s the nature of investment banking. If anything, it actually shows that Goldman’s equity research is truly independent.

Pretty much like another  GME situation.

I think it definitely drops to the 30s first,  there will be no deal.

Twitter has already said,  it was unsolicited and vanguard upped their stake.",1.0,u48onu,2022-04-15T14:32:52Z,2022-04-15
7729,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,TWTR acquisition price analysis/opinion,"The recent offer that Musk make for acquiring Twitter (TWTR) made me dig into what I would consider a reasonable price for the buyout. My initial thought was that Musk is very aggressive in his ""take it, or leave it, I'm not negotiating, offer for $54.20 per share"" and the offer honestly seems low. Why do I think so?

Musk is making an offer based on a daily price as two specific points of time - the day he purchased his 9.2% share and the day he disclosed it - but usually such offers are based on average stock price over a more extended period of time. Take Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATV), for example. Microsoft is paying a large premium over current price at the point of announcing the deal (close to 50%), but they are also paying a premium over the price on a MA200 basis. MA200 on January 14th has been at $81.23 despite recent downslide, which means Microsoft paid 17% premium on an MA200 basis, and also offered a price ($95 a share), which is below, but still close to 52-week high ($99.46).

**Summary** (MSFT acquisition of ATV)

* **17%** premium over MA200 price (**$81.23**)
* Price (**$95**) below but close to 52-week high (**$99.46**)

Now where is TWTR compared to that. As of April 14th, the MA200 is at $52.14 and the 52-week high is at $73.34. Elon's offer is mere 3.95% premium on the 200-day moving average and is way below the annual high. If we take the same % premium Microsoft was willing to pay, the price tag must be at at least $61. If he's really willing to pay 30% premium, then the price should be $67.78. This is still below the 52-week high, but would be a reasonable and acceptable offer for the shareholders.

**Summary** (Musk offer for TWRT)

* **3.95%** premium over MA200 price (**$52.14**)
* Offer (**$54.20**) way below 52-week high (**$73.34**)
* Acceptable offer at **30%** premium over MA200 is **$67.78.**

7741,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,I figured it all out. Elon and TWTR.,"Social media market is at it's lowest and pretty fragmented. Musk is bored and wants to have some fun (and cash).

What better way to get in the play then:

1. Ask in a poll weather social media needs a new platform that actually tells the truth
2. Receive the expected answer from your followers
3. Pretend to want to buy the platform so that you can change it to be the ONE
4. Fuck with the SEC in the interim (this is a very welcomed bonus for him and for all of us as well)
5. Fuck with the board of the company by pretending to joining the board only to let them know in a message you were actually trying to buy them out
6. Increase the value of your shares in the process by making a financial offer that they need to refuse and start looking for potential other buyers for a higher price while under the gun that if they don't accept it, you will lower the stock price by just offloading what you bought earlier (again lovely fucking with the SEC)
7. Sell out in a profit while having fun and a good laugh
8. Announce after liquidation that a new platform was cooking under, is ready and you just need to pay 2 USD / month to get on board. Watch TWTR, Snapchat, TikTok and Meta share price collapse.

Remind me in 6 months!

I find it amazing that nobody realizes the real proof there is already free speech is the fact he was allowed to make all this (yet) unrealized profit  and then just get away with a small fine. Good boy SEC.",15.0,u425hv,2022-04-15T06:56:20Z,2022-04-15

He'll probably sell loads more Teslas and Starlink systems. And he'll have a powerful political ally in Trump.

Analyst - $30 pt based on the current leadership. Yes a company has a lot of potential but management is proving they cannot capitalize on it. 

Advisory - Company has great market penetration, cultural relevance, dau, brand assets, contributor base. Under new leadership the price target could be closer to it's closest competitors such as fb.... based on a sum of it's parts breakdown.... Twtr could be as high as $150.

8484,twtr,stocks,COMMENT,What happens to the TWTR shares people own if Twitter agreed to Musk's 100% offer?,"Former M&A banker here.

Quick answer: As this is a cash deal, you'll receive cash @ $54.20/share upon closing. It'll be credited to your brokerage account. 

In terms of mechanics -  right now, it's the Board that votes. Generally, majority wins. Interestingly, the timing is unique bc Twitter is about to have its board meeting for the year - assuming the shareholders are mostly 'for' the sale, if the BoD doesn't vote accordingly, their seats are vulnerable. But I think I heard the BoD nomination window has closed, but wanted to add this detail.

Elon already suspects the BoD will not be receptive, he is calling for it to be a shareholder vote - which is generally based on majority. The bylaws will have the specifics, have to search for the 'drag along rights' section. It will detail the minimum % of the votes to 'drag along' the rest of the shareholders into the deal.

An additional complication, based on Elon's latest Tweets of trying to maximize the highest % he can 'take private' with him (ie, you get shares in the private Twitter), is interesting. I'm sure the lawyers are working very hard to find out how this would be structured. Considering that for most private investments you have to be an accredited investor to participate, I think this will be tricky if you are not a millionaire",3.0,u3jsm1,2022-04-15T02:31:58Z,2022-04-15

8513,twtr,stocks,COMMENT,What happens to the TWTR shares people own if Twitter agreed to Musk's 100% offer?,"Here is my understanding from my personal experience: board will vote to accept or reject. Reject means that musk can do hostile bid and his proposal goes directly to shareholders without board approval. Accept means proposal goes to shareholders with board blessing/recommendation. The proposal will likely need 90% approval at which point musk can force the last 10% to sell for 100% ownership. Musk could just aim for 50% ownership where he would have control over the company without owning all shares. This would allow him to change anything he wants without having to buy all shares. The shares not owned by musk could continue to trade publicly but musk would be sharing the profits in this scenario.

Board can try to put in poison pill to prevent the hostile bid. This means implementing negative ramifications when one shareholder gets too large of a position. Getting board agreement to the proposal would avoid this.",1.0,u3jsm1,2022-04-15T02:41:57Z,2022-04-15

8617,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",69.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

And that folks, is how you get a ""consulting firm"" to do your dirty deeds--but they are not done dirt cheap.

You know what is even sicker? Hiring a shitty cancerous vampire consulting firm like BCG to do your crime for you, but making the company that is the target of your hit pay the ""consulting fee.""

1. Start naked shorting and ""providing liquidity"" in a stock (internalizing buy orders and ""filling"" them with synthetic shares so there is no upward pressure on price)
2. Have a plant investor buy enough shares to influence the board, and put in a shitty mole CEO and/or CFO, who then begins making shit business decisions (like hiring BCG) and taking on debt backed by company assets.
3. Have BCG suggest one of your ""risk arbitrage"" hedge/corp bonds packages (don't call it a ""death spiral"" tho. *Death Spira*l FFS. Honestly, these guys cannot help twirling their fucking moustaches, can they?) which will allow the company to convert when share price gets too low, incentivising insider shorting and putting more leverage in Citadel's hands.
4. After years of shitty business decisions at the cynical advice of BCG, and all the debt on the balance sheets making the stock look undesirable, the business declines and the stock gets cellar boxed. When it goes to 0 Citadel hits the bankruptcy jackpot, pays BCG their bonus, Amazon or whatever competitor is involved scoops up cheap assets and market share.
5. The moral arc of the universe takes another dump thanks to evil parasites.

9053,fb,wallstreetbets,POST,Why has FB tanked so hard?,"This might not be the place to appeal to the fundamentals of a stock but I'm left scratching my head looking at this company's financial statements and the price action. 

FB has great margins, great revenue growth for their size, more cash and short term investments on their balance sheet than ALL (not just current) liabilities, great operational performance, and are pushing into what is being labelled as a ""new trillion dollar industry"" in the metaverse.

I know that Apple's new privacy rules are cause for concern and that the metaverse is not a sure thing. But I'd be willing to bet that they can figure out some way to either get around the privacy concerns or spy on their users some other way lol. As far as the metaverse is concerned I don't feel inclined to bet against Mark Zuckerberg, he is one of the most successful people at his age in human history (someone else made a post here about that, pretty well thought out.) Even if the venture doesn't produce any cash flow in the next few years, do you think they'd just keep pouring money into it or do you think they would just discontinue it? 

I've also heard the monthly average user argument, which I find so dumb. When they have somewhere in the ball park of 3.5 BILLION people (or registered users) who use one of their apps I would expect them to see some tapering in growth considering a world population of 7.9 billion. Even if there was some decline in MAU they are still the best in the industry at extracting revenue from each user, and that growth rate has been very steadily increasing since it went public. 

Before anyone mentions Tik Tok, I am aware they are eating FB's lunch, they're the most concerning factor right now in my mind.",0.0,u3x3xs,2022-04-15T01:51:32Z,2022-04-15

Not sure that's a product anyone really wants. Zuckerberg has been successful, but he's made a lot of mistakes along the way and with increasing competition in that market space with Twitter taking up most of the headlines these days and tik Tok taking up most of the younger generation that generally make or break social media companies, it definitely seems like FB is past the point of hitting the iceburg.",5.0,u3x3xs,2022-04-15T02:04:28Z,2022-04-15

9479,nvda,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",73.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

9593,amd,wallstreetbets,POST,Long $AMD - My Next Potential 10X AMD Trade,"Hi fellow apes,

Long time no see.

Some of you may remember me from my two insane $AMD trades last year, both of which [went up 1000%](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qzngtn/85k_to_850k_10x_in_2_months_im_not_selling/).I have one of those for you today.

This is a multi-pronged thesis for why I went long on $AMD at these levels, which I will summarize in the following points :

\-- Macro Picture --

The market has just experienced a major correction which lasted several months and was fueled by the fed tightening monetary policy. I believe the correction is over and the market has now gotten used to a more hawkish fed.

The fed has gotten more Hawkish due to inflation, which I believe will begin stabilizing and even subsiding over the next several quarters. Primarily because  :

1- Consumer demand and spending has been declining for two months and will continue to do so IMO, due to a moderation of govt spending bills, stimulus money running out and savings declining.

2- Because inflation of energy prices due to the Russian-Ukaranian war has mostly already been baked in since March.

Slowing inflation can give leeway to the fed to turn less hawkish, which can fuel a major bull market rally.

\-- AMD's Fundamental Picture --

AMD's price has been cut by nearly half since its major peak last year at around \~$160. Nothing fundamental about AMD's business has changed. The company even raised its growth expectations for 2022 in its last earnings call. AMD is expected to grow its revenue by no less than 60% by the end of the year and more than double its profit.

In my opinion demand for semiconductors continues to be very strong and will remain so for the remainder of the year. AMD successfully completed its acquisition of XLNX late last year, which strengthens its competitive position in the server business, an area where the it's been kicking ass and taking record breaking market share from Intel.  In fact more than a quarter of all x86 CPUs sold today are AMD, the [highest market share](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-amd-4q-2021-2022-market-share-desktop-notebook-server-x86) in history for AMD.

The company is also expected to release the first ever 5nm x86 ""Zen 4"" CPUs [this year](https://www.techspot.com/news/92835-amd-ces-2022-roadmap-zen-4-am5-ryzen.html), which will extend its manufacturing process lead vs Intel and allow it capture even more market share and grow profitability and expand margins.

\-- AMD's Technical Picture --

In my opinion there's a strong likelihood that AMD has bottomed here at the \~$90 level. Here's why :

\- We tagged the 100-day moving average for the first time since April 2018. The last time this happened AMD went up from $10 to $30 in six months.

\- We hit a double bottom on the daily RSI after a major peak. The last time this happened was Dec 2018 and AMD went up by 60% the following 6 weeks.

\- AMD has been on a very strong bullish trend since 2016. The stock just entered the most attractive ""gray"" buy zone in my hand drawn pitchfork channel. This has only happened 3 times in the last 5 years. Following those 3 instances AMD went up by 38%, 240% & 66% respectively.

Other random shit I'm looking at:

Interesting option data from yesterday, looks like $18.6M in 01/23 155p were sold. Someone closing out a huge put position, will try to track down when these were purchased to confirm.

I'm also looking at the $90-$92 level for a bounce. 50% retracement from the low in May2021 and substantial support going back to Sep2020. 

A few analysts downgrading AMD has pushed price down to like a 160 day low? OK. Right.

Lisa Su estimated that the chip shortage will be less severe in 2nd half of 2022, this was back in Sep2021.

TSM had positive earnings this week. I wonder who they manufacture chips for? Hmmmm.

AMD was well ahead of supply chain issues at the very start of COVID, they plan for demand years in advance. 

They've also released data on a new ""gaming"" chip last week that is almost 1/2 the cost of the Intel equivalent (sort of).",31.0,u446bu,2022-04-15T10:55:01Z,2022-04-15

9648,amd,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not. 

&#x200B;

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery.

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",69.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

9834,amzn,stocks,POST,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","Follow-up to my MSFT/GOOGL/NVDA post earlier this week (resolution there was to keep all three but perhaps trim them some).  **This is part two, but will likely be the last such post for a while as I do not intend to bombard you with these types of posts (I know they might get annoying) but do value your feedback.**

What are your thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM?  By long-term I mean for the next 5-10 years, and taking into consideration various scenarios like stagflation, recessions, or on the flip side, an economic boom if Powell can figure out inflation and Putin loses his war quickly.

My preliminary thoughts:

* AMZN: Overall, I see it as a good stock with a weakening moat.  AWS is their crown jewel and will likely remain so, but they are facing increasing competition from MSFT, GOOGL and others (e.g. ORCL, IBM, but these are to a much lesser extent).  E-Commerce appears to be slower growth especially given the immense costs of capex (delivery, warehouses).  E-Commerce is facing increasing competition from others like TGT, WMT, and SHOP, and the first two of these are already big box stores and thus do not need to spend as much on capex to ramp up.  For example, TGT/WMT offer buy and pick up services, which while not as convenient as AMZN prime, is still pretty useful (I use it sometimes).  Bottom line, I fear AMZN's growth will be slower going forward, which does not bode well as its PE is also quite a bit higher than MSFT and GOOGL.

* ADBE: Its software is ubiquitous, but seems to have stalled out on growth.  My favorite segment of theirs is actually the Experience Cloud, which appears unique but is having inconsistent results.  Document Cloud faces heavy competition from Docusign, etc. and anyway is free for most users (Adobe Acrobat Reader) or already installed (meaning incremental revenue would have to come from fee increases and not necessarily new licenses).  Creative Cloud remains good, but it is mostly focused on 2D AFAIK.  If 3D imaging continues to gain steam, I see ADSK and U being better.  Bottom line and as with AMZN, competition and over-saturation are issues.

* CRM: It appears quite clear that its sales platform is saturated, and it appears that even Marc Benioff knows that (hence the Tableau and Slack acquisitions).  I see the Analytics Cloud as being potentially the biggest gamechanger of theirs as Tableau's competitors are rather weak and smaller companies (e.g. Alteryx).  I have heard that Microsoft has a competing product called PowerBI, but I don't know exactly how it stacks up to Tableau.  Not sure though if the Analytics Cloud will be enough to take CRM to significantly higher growth (e.g. 20%+ revenue growth yoy).",18.0,u4dsoz,2022-04-15T17:57:37Z,2022-04-15

9839,amzn,stocks,COMMENT,"Thoughts on the long-term growth of AMZN, ADBE, and CRM","I think a truly long-term investor need not worry too much about the current macro environment when evaluating these companies. Amazon looks fairly cheap; Adobe looks a little expensive. Both wonderful businesses. Haven’t analyzed CRM.

The thing about Amazon is that their current net income is comically low compared to what they could show if they wanted to. They also still have a lot of room for growth in all of their major businesses (e.g. ads, AWS, third party sellers, etc). They will likely face some temporary headwinds from supply chain and inflation issues, maybe some upward wage pressure across the board, maybe some regulatory issues. I think they may have some issues with retaining top talent given the low wages, poor benefits. I also worry about the fact that we have to depend on the management to transition from growth mode to earnings mode without destroying too much capital along the way.

All of that said, my DCF with relatively conservative assumptions still tells me it’s cheap, so I say it’s cheap.",8.0,u4dsoz,2022-04-15T18:52:24Z,2022-04-15

10042,vix,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",75.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

10119,qqq,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea.

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either.

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",72.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

10252,appl,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-14-22 SPY, QQQ, AMD, NVDA, F, Apple, VIX Weekly TA","  Wow that week flew by! Almost like it was only four days or something… In all reality we pretty much had a sideways week with the price action between 436.65 and 445.75, a 2.19% range but with the majority of the time spent between 438 and 443 for a $5 range or 1.1% range up/ down. That’s a really tight range for the week. Which also provided us with one of the lowest total volume weeks (granted we missed a whole day) of 346million. Lowest volume week since December.

Tuesday, Wednesday and Today ALMOST make me think that we have finally returned to a “normal” spy. What do I mean by this? Well historically SPY opening hour can be a little chaotic but then its settles into a trend. So like today we saw a pop then started to sell off and that was confirmed by closing candles below the 8ema on the 15min chart. The historical predictable SPY then continues that trend until it rests (like we saw at 1115/ 1130) where SPY closes a candle body (or one candle) above the 8ema to “rest” before it pushes lower. However, then we have the 130pm time frame today. This one was a very convincing reversal that we have been seeing time and time again on SPY. The only difference this time looking back is how the VIX did not fully unwind. 

Historically one of my strategies that I have coined as the 123 rollercoaster involves what today did. It involves a trend move… Spy dipping to 440.6 à it involves a rest period… SPY breaking back above the 8ema… Spy breaking to 442.3 à then it involves spy pushing past the first trend move… so this case would be Spy breaking to 439.6. Before the last id say two or three weeks I would play this strategy almost daily and be very successful with it. The only issue is that right now this market has no problem doing a 180 and reversing trend mid day. I have over the last few weeks been burnt numerous times trying to play this move. Of course today is the one day I sold and prepared myself for calls and got double burnt -\_\_\_-. 

My point in this is that the last three days of SPY have been very strong trend moves that have held true to their trend all day (once established around 10 to 11am). I will be watching going into next week if the same holds true or not.

This mornings pre-market TA (available on the server) I mentioned that I re-worked my 15min bear channel. It held true today. We saw SPY top out at 444.73 before falling all the way to 437.68. Yesterday it had appeared to have broken the channel but upon analyzing my points and readjusting we have now a very strong downward channel that dates back to March 29th, nearly two weeks of downward movement overall). 

&#x200B;

I also mentioned it was KEY for bulls to keep it above the purple support line if they wanted to key bullish momentum going into next week, however, they failed to do so today. It was quite the fight at 439.5 support but ultimately the bears won the day. We now finish the week dead center in the red downward channel with room to go either way next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7h7c2ne6flt81.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0a846b916b4e8e867a1203b63d3b04a0eff9595

I had mentioned in my daily TA last night that I thought we could see a red day today (though I actually was bracing for a bull day). I drew the four arrows which showed one green candle followed by two or three red candles. If this trend holds true, and the three day weekend does not flip the trend we should see another red day come Monday. But looking at apple, QQQ and SPY I am not convinced we see another red day. 

Bull case for spy next week- We have found incredible support here at the 437-438 range closing three candles bodies right here. After three days of rejecting the daily 8ema we FINALLY wicked above the daily 8ema. We also tested resistance at the daily 50ema today again. With yesterday low being 437.84 and today closing at 437.79 (with a low of 437.68) its safe to call this a double bottom Wednesday candle saw very similar price action in this area too with a close at 438.29 and a slightly lower low at 436.65. That is nearly a triple bottom. Bulls will need SPY to have a green day Monday, closing the candle ABOVE the daily 200 ema (440) and then follow it up with another green candle closed ABOVE the daily 8ema (443.53) to get some bull momentum flowing. 

Bear case for spy next week- bulls failed once again to close a candle above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100 ema. Bears also were able to close the candle below the daily 200 ema for the third time this week and the fourth candle body below the daily 200ema. Bears have formed a nice channel going into next week also. Bears will look for Monday to keep the candle completely below the daily 200 ema (440) and close somewhere closer to the 435 range. Ultimate goal for bears will be to get SPY down near 425 to 430 EOW. 

We have no more fed news that I can see (unless a surprise thing happens) until May 3rd. We are approaching earnings season here now though over the next two weeks. Next week brings a slue of more financial based and bank earnings.   
 Tuesday- Airlines, Lockheed martin, casino stocks, Netflix (oof we all remember that last earnings lol), J&J

Wednesday- abbott labs, airlines, proctor and gamble, TESLA (hmmm)

Thursday- more airlines, at&t, SNAP

Friday- nothing too notable

So the big ones going into next week will obviously be Netlfix on Tuesday, tesla on Wednesday and then SNAP on Thursday. It will be interesting to see how TESLA does and how they kick off earnings for big tech. I do think they will set the tone.

Apple had a just awful day today. I have never seen apple fall so much but so slowly at the same time. This was not the usually massive red candles down we see this was a very slowwwww drop all day long. Crazy to see for sure. I had mentioned last night had they not been able to break 171 this morning we would look for next natural support at 168.5 (daily 50 ema) which we did bounce at for a while before ultimately losing that and closing BELOW the daily 100ema. Apple had one hell of a day today (in a bad way). We are still well within our bear channel for apple. 

Bull case for apple- I lean towards a bullish bottom being in this week for apple. Monday we saw a bottom of 165.5 amd a close of 165.75 following by todays bottom of 165 and a close of 165.29. This very well can be taken as a clear double bottom and a clear double bottom at a crucial support such as the daily 100 ema which is already pretty darn low for Apple to be trading at. Bulls also were able to once again break the daily 8ema (this time with a candle body) before falling down. 

Bulls will look to get apple Monday back above the daily 50ema at 168.44 and close the candle ABOVE that. They would look to follow that up with a candle closed above both the daily 8 and daily 20ema at 169.76. 

Bear case for apple- overall since March 30th apple has failed to make a new higher high. Price action is downward in nature with a two new lower lows this week (Mondays 165.5 and todays 165.04). Bears also managed to close two FULL candles below the daily 100ema this week which is a big hit to the bulls. Bears will look to make a new lower low Monday breaking Apple down near the 161 range before ultimately trying to get this back to the 200ema at 157.51. 

Today I loaded my IRA with Apple Shares as I found this to be a good buying opportunity. I am waiting for level 2 approval coming next week at which point I most likely will convert them to some Jun 21 2024 (799DTE) calls.

AMD is continuing its path to the bottom of the earth. AMd attempted to make an early morning run for the $100 line again but failed to reach even $99 before it was rejected lower. Bears ultimately brought it all the way down to its lowest recent closer of $92.92. 

This will be the last TA for AMD for a while as I no longer will be holding a position in it. But here is a quick case for many of you to watch and how I MAY play it. 

Looking at recent price action there is a case for support to be had around $90 à $85 à 80 à and ultimately my target I mentioned of $75. Unless we see a total market collapse these next two weeks I suspect AMD to find support near the $80 to $85 range. 

For the last four earnings in a row AMD has surpassed all expectations and continues to always BEAT earnings. MY thoughts is that we will see AMD continue to trickle down for the next week and/ or find support near one of those happy places (probably $80-$85 at this pace) and then will see a bullish recovery once AMD has earnings sometime before May 3rd. A strong earnings after such an incredible beat down seeing a drop from $126 to $92 in two weeks would make sense. AMD just has not found a strong enough support bounce yet… some of which is related to the 10year yield sky rocketing, inflation and overall market fuckery. 

&#x200B;

Someone asked me to include a TA on NVDA which relates to AMD here so im adding it in hopes they see it… Overall NVDA has been getting its dick slapped by everyone too. Seeing massive drops over the last two week too. NVDA looks to have finally found a support range. However the $209 is the bottom of what I would call strong support (think $100 level for AMD). A dip below that and it may keep selling off for a while into earnings. Overall if NVDA (and tech in general) can get their feet back under them and hold the line at $209-$210 and see the range of $220 again I believe NVDA is a hell of a good buying opportunity here. Being 28% of its recent highs and 40% from its 52 week high. 

I make the same case for AMD also. AMD is currently 27% of recent high and 44% of its 52 week high… that’s a hell of a discount. If and when these two finally find a bottle and I suspect it may be soon some long long dated calls (think 1 year out+ ) would be a hell of a great opportunity. Even two or three years out in case we do see a recession would be a great idea. 

&#x200B;

Ford actually started to show some recovery like movement this week and I went ahead and closed my Ford puts also. 

I will be watching for ford after four attempts to break its daily 8ema and looking like it could today, close a candle above next week. Looks like Ford is projected to have earnings on April 28th and that will be very interesting to say the least to see how they end up. 

Ford is 40% of its 52 week high… Another one that could be seen as a great LEAP canadite over the next week or so. I would definitely wait until May when earnings are done to see if it catches a bad earnings and you may get an opportunity to buy closer to that $13 range I mentioned before. 

I will be out of my FORD puts now and not planning to re-enter so I will not be including it in future TA right now either. 

&#x200B;

Ah yes last but not least… the QQQ’s. These bad boys are like apple and SPY looking poised for a recovery here soon in my opinion. Looking at the daily chart you can see we managed to remain IN the bear channel however we did touch the upper resistance for the first time in two weeks. I also want to point out (while hard to see) if you follow the red close line all the way across the chart you see QQQ just touched the lows of January 24th to January 28th this week. There is quite the case to argue this is a massive inverse head and shoulders bull pattern (see pic below). 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lm70ijdaflt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4bc47c085135d680119ab2f913c2be66aed9793

Its one of my LEAST favorite patterns to trade but when its actually accurately found it plays out hugely. I just feel the head and shoulder type patterns are so arbitrary and so self fulfilling I do not like to utilize them but when Its very obvious I will point it out. There is a small case for this pattern that we could see QQQ hit as low as 334ish this next week before it would start its ultimate climb back to ATH. The one very interesting thing above QQQ having this pattern is that Apple and SPY have the EXACT same pattern, however, the only difference is that Apple and Spy have not reached the “shoulder” yet like QQQ has. Apple would need to see 155-160 and SPY would need to see 427-432 (which if you remember I was calling for 430 this week and was anticipating a pattern move like this… I do wonder if I was maybe one week too early). 

Bull case for QQQ- this finally saw an official daily 8ema resistance line test at 346.91 today which is the first official test in nearly two weeks (when it broke below it). The daily 100ema failed to cross below the daily 200ema this week. Bears failed to break lower lows this week with all four candle bodies bottoms near 339.9. There is an arguable double bottom at 338.21 (today) and 338.04 (Tuesday low) that could see a bounce back towards 345-350 come Monday. 

Bulls will need to see a big move back up Monday near the daily 8ema (I doubt they would see a close above it unless they had some wildly amazing day). They would look for the follow up candle to close ABOVE the daily 8ema at 346.91 and then continue the momentum end of week to close above the 100/200 ema near 358-359. 

Bear case for QQQ- Bulls failed to breakout above the daily 8ema when the opportunity presented them. Lower low was made once again this week with a failure to make a higher high than last week.  

Bears will need to see another level down Monday to make an official lower low with a target of 332-335 Monday and follow it up with an end of week target near 315-320.

The VIX is always the star of the show but today it was quite interesting to see that it was trading within such a tight range seeing only 8% of range movement compared to its average of nearly 14-15% the other three days this week. As you can see by my “levels” on the VIX chart it has really been seasawig from about 18.7 to 24.8 for the last really month now. The VIX happy place really seems to be this 23.9 to 20.9 range though which seems to be where it has spent most of its time. The VIX appears to be on an upcycle right now headed back towards 25 which could spell more downward movement for SPY and the market next week unless it is able to see a clean gap down Monday at open and start its way back to 19.

I am currently holding NO positions over night right now. Someone made a great comment on my TA post the other day that said something along the lines for “you are a great trader but you aren’t a weather forecaster.” Me being me who is dead inside and doesn’t get hurt by what people say really took some time today to analyze that comment as it kinda caught me off guard. Then I really did start to analyze why I was in these Ford, AMD and even the Apple longer DTE puts. Did I really think I was correct? Was the risk worth the reward? The answer I came up with was no it was not. 

The one apple put which became a 0dte today I had to close for -90% because it got burnt and ate up by theta so badly. Of course it was a “small” position but that L turned a great week into an okay week. 

I had the 15dte apple puts that were down I believe about 30% at open that crawled to as high as 20% (and woulda been more like 50% EOD) but I ended up closing them for 5% gains around the 130pm bull trap that I fell for. 

I close my Ford and AMD puts both for 5-6% gains end of day today too. The AMD put was getting all sorts of IV crushed and beat up with the way AMD swings. I was happy to salvage green on that. The Ford put was really the most stable of them all trending only as low as -10% at one time today before I was able to salvage a small win when the market dumped EOD. 

Why did I close all these? Did I lose my conviction in them? Was it a bad play? Yes and no really. I wouldn’t say I lost my conviction in them, but watching my puts go from up 20% to down 30% over night and the apple puts that were once green at 20% having to be closed at -90% really doesn’t sit well with me. 

I am a day trader. I do very well and have a fairly successful day trading win rate and profits to show for it. I do not do well with swings nor do I do well with tolerance on them and “commitment” on them. For me its not worth the risk to reward to be swinging options right now. With that being said I do want to see the market get to a place where I feel comfortable picking up and holding LEAPs for QQQ, SPY and maybe MSFT or APPLE. Overall in the end the market goes up and at some point I do need to stop fighting that trend. 

I have no idea what this crazy wild market is going to do, if the feds will tank it with too many rates, if we will see a recession or not. But the one thing I can tell at least right now is that the market is holding its own weight. I mentioned I added Apple shares to my IRA currently and that is my plan for now to just add shares of apple to that. My non-ira account I am still sitting all cash but once I feel we have a better direction overall of things I will look to go long on some LEAPS most likely after this earnings season and the next FOMC meeting May 3rd/ 4th where we get another 50bps hike and will have another CPI rate upcoming. The market overall is holding its own but I do not trust it.

Weekly trade log-

I made 33 total trades this week (28 puts and 5 calls.. quite the difference). 

My total weekly win rate was 72%. 

Put win rate was 79% 

Call win rate was only 40%. 

My biggest losses also came on puts and my biggest wins too. 

My weekly profit goal is $2500 but with the short week was only $2000. 

Realized profits were $2004 this week. When I factor in the swing puts on apple and spy and overall over trading I should have seen 2-3x that realized profits. This week I worked on taking a step back from trading the opening bell and I would say that was moderately successful. 

20 of my 29 (excluding the 4 swing trades) trades were 0-2 DTE for a win rate of 65%

10 of my 29 trades were 3+DTE for a win rate of 70%. So realistically my 3+dte has a better win rate. 

This is the first time ive analyzed my weekly trades this much. 

Looking back at the last month of data for more information…

76 trades made for 0-2dte with a win rate of 64.5% win rate

30 trades made for 3+dte with a win rate of 73% win rate. 

That’s quite the difference in win rates. This next week I am going to challenge myself to trade strictly 3-5dtes. My theory here knowing my trade style is that most of this 0-2dte are quick scalps where im a little higher risk on and usually slightly smaller position size vs. when I do a 3-5dte is usually a larger position size and subsequentially a more established and confident trend. 

I look forward to next week to see how things will shape up. 

NOTE- Next week Friday I will be out of town for a bachelor party. I will try and get a weekly TA up on Sunday night if I can and have time but there is a good chance I just wont be able to post one as I have a pretty long drive back home from there. 

This also means on Friday I will NOT be trading that day. I will be mobile driving to Nashville for the weekend and may make some trades mobile if I see something super great but will definitely not be on the server. 

Thursday morning I am also picking up my friend from the airport for this weekend trip so I will be gone in the AM for a little while near opening bell but will update about the specifics come Thursday but wanted to give everyone a heads up.

I hope everyone has a great weekend! See you Monday!",75.0,u3wd29,2022-04-15T01:12:00Z,2022-04-15

10444,appl,stocks,POST,Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay,"When the Apple M1 series came out, lots of people were saying that x86 is doomed, Intel and AMD will be out of business and every big tech companies will be designing their own ARM-based processor. In my opinion, these statements are quite detached from reality and is a display of lack of understanding of semiconductor and technology. Here's why:

1. It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team: Apple started using their in-house designed ARM-based architecture with the iPhone 4S, which was released in 2011. They should be working on the architecture at least 2 years prior to that, which means it takes Apple more than 10 years to be able to build the M1 series. Almost every generation of Apple's in-house design has a huge efficiency advantage over the standard ARM core, which implies the design team of Apple is far more capable than the team in ARM and Qualcomm. Despite that, it still takes them more than 10 years to accumulate the technical legacy and experience to make the M1 series. Few other companies can afford to spend that amount of money and time do built a design team as capable as Apple's, even if they could, it could still be more expensive than just buying processors from Intel or AMD.
2. It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture: processors are expensive, but the time of competent software engineers is even more expensive. Good software engineers are required if you want to migrate your software to a different ISA and have it performing well, and they are expensive and rare. It makes more financial sense for companies to assign these engineers to other purposes than to re-write software that runs fine on existing hardware. On top of that, most companies doesn't have the complete control over their platform like Apple does on OSX and iOS, which would makes this task even harder, more expensive and time-consuming.
3. Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node: Apple started using the TSMC N5 process more than 1 year earlier than almost everybody else, which is a significant contributing factor to the efficiency advantage of the M1 series. Even datacenter products with extremely high margin such as the AMD EPYC and Nvidia A100 are one generation behind in terms of process node. It takes an insane amount of money to design a processor on the most advanced process node, hundreds of millions for N5, billions is expected for N3. If processor vendors like AMD and Nvidia can't race Apple to the most advanced node, processors for in-house usage by Google, Amazon or Microsoft definitely won't have the volume to do so.
4. The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains ""only"" roughly 54 billion transistors.  While the M1 Max is powerful, it's definitely not as powerful as the RTX 3080 and 5900X combined, even if it contains more transistors. If only fabbing cost is considered, a M1 Max is more expensive to manufacture than 2 RTX 3080 since the cost per transistor stopped dropping since 28nm. The design of M1 series sacrifices transistor efficiency for energy efficiency, which makes sense for mobile products, but for HPC applications better transistor efficiency should be more desirable. AMD and Nvidia products are still more efficient in terms of computing power to manufacturing cost ratio.

In conclusion, the M1 series is the result of Apple pouring tremendous amount of resource over a long time, which most companies can't afford to do. Even if they could, it would probably make more financial sense to simply purchase processors from existing vendors.",221.0,u44fqe,2022-04-15T09:44:55Z,2022-04-15

This isn’t super true especially for higher levels of the stack. Device drivers and low level OS code, yeah, but for everything else it’s not hard to port to a different architecture. It’s way way harder to port to a different OS or even graphics library. The real cost is testing cycles and infrastructure, not the code.

Linux already runs well on ARM and Microsoft has windows ARM. In the medium term, I wouldn’t be surprised if more server side stuff moves to Linux on ARM. Performance per watt especially considering cooling costs is far superior on ARM and single thread performance isn’t that important. I’m surprised it isn’t the standard already.",22.0,u44fqe,2022-04-15T16:00:50Z,2022-04-15
10448,appl,stocks,COMMENT,Why the success of Apple M1 series is hard to replicate for other companies and x86 is here to stay,"I don't really disagree, but I think you are overstating things.  So here are my disagreements.

> It takes a lot of money and time to built a world-class chip-design team

Agreed, but I think there are more than a few companies that could do that (or arguably already have).  Samsung, Broadcom, qualcom, or nVidia to name a few.

> It takes even more time and money to re-write software for a different architecture

Less time now-a-days than ever before.  Particularly if you are already targeting an existing architecture like ARM.  Apple didn't make a new ARM instruction set.

Very little modern software is written in such a way to make it dependent on the instruction set.

> Few companies can afford to use the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing node.

While true, the same companies I pointed out earlier ARE already using those advanced nodes from TSMC.  Really, the only difference is they've not chosen to enter the server market.

However, that's something that's been changing as of late.  Because of ARM's somewhat natural energy efficiency you are starting to see cloud providers offer ARM based systems.

It's really only a matter of time for some of these mobile manufacturers to decide they want a large piece of the pie.

> The M1 series is actually quite transistor-inefficient: the M1 Max contains 57 billion transistors, in comparison, the RTX 3080 contains about 28 billion transistors and the Ryzen 5900X contains about 19 billion transistors, even the Nvidia A100 contains ""only"" roughly 54 billion transistors.

You can't really point at transistor numbers and draw much meaningful conclusions.  M1 Max is both a CPU + GPU.  Further, it has a rather monstrously sized L2 cache (24MB).  The 5900X has a 4MB L2.  That's not really being inefficient with transistors.

But even so.. so what?  Transistor count might push up die space requirements which decreases yield, but that's not really terribly impactful on the bottom line.",9.0,u44fqe,2022-04-15T16:00:19Z,2022-04-15

It gives Apple more control of cost structure and makes software easier to test (ie they only have to worry about performance on a couple of hardware targets).
I think Amazon, Google and Microsoft can use this model for servers, if they want, but designing and maintaining new chips is super expensive, so if Intel or amd are making chips that are ""good enough"", there's not much cost justification to maintain the design team. Worst case for them would be if they spent billions on a home brew chip, then Intel releases something better that same year.",1.0,u44fqe,2022-04-15T14:43:23Z,2022-04-15

You make reasonable points, but the news seems to point in the opposite direction.

The next generation of ARM essentially builds into the architecture the features that Apple has been creating from scratch and making them available to the parties that choose to license out ARM designs so they configure them to make their own chips.
