1158,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Netflix (NFLX) reported an unexpected decline in first-quarter net subscribers,"Even if NFLX drops 25% tomorrow it would still be overvalued IMO. There's just not enough money to be made in content alone. Content is not a strong moat, and without a moat you have zero pricing power and crappy margins. If I can get decent enough content on Disney+ with ads or with my Amazon Prime subscription then why wouldn't I just find stuff to watch there?

They need find other monetisation streams or to build out a more fully-featured streaming platform. What Disney does right is that content is just a starting point. If your kid likes Frozen or Marvel they're going to want all the Frozen and Marvel gizmos for Christmas, and they're going to beg you all year to take them to Disney World. Disney only cares about content as much as it provides them with unique IP that they can sell experiences and products with pricing power. It drives me nuts that I have to spend £30 on some crappy plastic Marvel toy every Christmas, but that's the genius of what Disney does, if your kid wants the latest spiderman toy, you're probably going to buy it regardless of price. This probably why Disney is fine with an ad model. They can lose money on the content itself so long as they can make enough money elsewhere from that content.

I'm not sure Netflix can replicate the theme park & merch model of Disney, but they could explore alternatives like video games and include that in their subscription. If Netflix offered me a library of video content, video games, music & audiobooks, I'd probably be more happy to pay their prices -- especially if it meant I could cancel my Spotify subscription. As it stands the only reason I still pay for Netflix is because my girlfriend likes to watch Friends on there. It's a total waste of money, but I cba to argue about it. If they continue to try to compete on content alone the stock should probably trade with a PE in the mid-teens.",22.0,u7e8x7,2022-04-19T20:46:01Z,2022-04-19

1266,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Thoughts on Netflix ($NFLX) Earnings today after hours?,"I genuinely think we're going to see a bunch of streaming services die. Every one is complaining about the price of Netflix but other companies services are priced even cheaper, they aren't sustainable long term prices, it's the new customer acquisition price. 

Everybody has launched a service now and we're going to see them all start ticking prices up. It's the same content as cable except with overall higher production values, the margins on cable were never insanely high or anything so why would you expect the same content delivered differently to be a fraction of the price? 

It's becoming clear most people want Netflix etc when it's $10 but not when it's $20. But if it needs to be $23 long term to be profitable where does that leave you?",6.0,u7a3t0,2022-04-19T20:41:25Z,2022-04-19

1269,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Thoughts on Netflix ($NFLX) Earnings today after hours?,"Netflix pays a fortune for content. Disney+ already has masses of its own content that it doesn't have to pay for. This means Netflix is going to struggle due to much higher costs which means they will need to keep increasing subscription fees or stop investing in new content. Also, to be blunt, Netflix is increasingly focused on ""woke"" shows, which appeals to some viewers, but alienates others. All of this makes me worry about the growth potential of Netflix. I don't see it experiencing a sudden death, but I do see it stagnating or declining over time. It has mutated from a growth stock to an (at best) value stock, but more likely a stagnating stock.",1.0,u7a3t0,2022-04-19T20:00:58Z,2022-04-19

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn’t “manipulation” it’s just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.  It's one big conspiracy that will one day be excused as a preventative measure to prevent foreign countries from disrupting our markets after the 9/11 tragedy (or something else that pulls on our heartstrings).

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Edit:  We will see real market value once Darkpools are closed and all trades are on the exchange.  Until then, this private practice needs to be revolutioned.

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn’t “manipulation” it’s just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

These are some of the biggest companies tracking the S&P, which is.... made up of the biggest companies.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index. There's plenty of damning evidence of market manipulation, we shouldn't muddy it up with something that seems normal.",2.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T17:55:27Z,2022-04-19

As shareholders of any company (please set aside Twitter for the purpose of this discussion), would you be satisfied if a $48 stock went as high as $54? Are you claiming that THAT was your ultimate price target...a $6 increase from the current value??

Twitter is not speculation. It is and always has been a long-term investment. IMHO, Twitter has a growth potential, and is one of those companies that could go high into the triple digits.

I brought up GME for a reason. Most of us have ""the moon"" as a price target for GME. Whatever that is remains personal and subjective, but it's fair to presume that it's WAY ABOVE $150/share. I dare say, it's up in the 4-digit land. Please tell me I'm off here. Elon's offer of $54 is about 12% more than current. Taking that same percentage, $165/share would be Elon's offer for GME.

There is no rational market. The unstoppable force of Wall St corruption meets the immovable object of Patrick Stars that just buy and hold, no matter green or red dildos.

>	This is how the market SHOULD work.

“Should” went out the door with manipulation and naked shorting. 

It went out the door with the doubling down (or worse) by the bad actors and the spending over a year of nonstop media bashing and utter nonfeasance on behalf of the government to try to get retail to sell. It went out the door with changing the rules as they went, with moving to swaps and having the CFTC conveniently hide swaps data until Oct. 2023.

“Should” went out the door when retail stopped acting rational. When it went Neo and began to believe. When people diamond hand this stock no matter where it goes, up 50% or down 50%. When people just buy more and hold.

As that Houston Wade guy said a year ago: “it’s art of war mastery by a bunch of idiots.”",851.0,u6pp8i,2022-04-19T01:28:03Z,2022-04-19

It's total nonsense and always has been. Assets are regularly mispriced to both the upside and downside. If you can keep your head and manage your own psychology you can profit from the volitility. You buy when the market hates an asset and sell when the market changes its mind. Take current Warren Buffett favorite OXY as an example. In 2020 the price was 20 bucks and he got a dividend paid in shares. He sold them immediately. That looked smart in the short term as the stock went down to 8 dollars that year. Today a year and a half later and the stock is at 62 bucks and ole uncle Warren rebought the shares he sold at 20 when it was between 40 to 60. Literally no one, not even the best capitalist of all time can tell the future which is why the efficient market nonsense doesn't work. I on the other hand bought OXY at 10.50 average because I know the oil industry well and knew the stock was badly mispriced. Stick to things you know and you can profit from trading with emotional people who don't understand what they are buying.

2003,gme,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I still don't understand how GME doesn't defy the efficient market hypothesis.,"It's really not that complicated. GameStop is a retail-backed start-up with a legacy business attached. The ""analysts"" are ragging on it for its legacy business but the market is evaluating it based on its potential, much to the dismay of short sellers who loaded up their positons back when GameStop *was* arguably a ""dying brick and mortar"". 

The ensuing short squeeze WILL be the mother of all short squeezes, though how high it goes is anyone's guess. And it will happen when the rest of the market realizes they were consuming bad information about the stock.

An essential component to an efficient market is the rapid dissemination of reliable information. Financial reporting has been hijacked by interest groups who control the information that market participants have access to. And as a result it has caused distortions.

So if you think the valuation doesn't make any sense, then you're looking at it wrong.",147.0,u6pp8i,2022-04-19T00:53:54Z,2022-04-19

I'm currently at Booth where the EMH was invented and popularized, and even here nobody thinks EMH is 100% accurate.

We invented a whole new field of behavioral economics to look at stuff including violations of the EMH. If you're interested go read Misbehaving by Thaler and also look at the history of the Palm stock.

Also, I don't think your post is about the EMH as much as models like CAPM. GME's rise is actually pretty explicable within the context of traditional economics, just the incentives are weird: people seem to derive huge utility from buying and holding GME.

It isn't like everyone decides to buy on the same day, at the same time.

So I was considering what is going to be my next long play/plays after GME inevitably moons and we are all filthy rich 💦

Considering how inflation is here to stay. Me as an simple smooth brained ape gravitated towards alternative energy solutions. 

I try to keep things simple, it’s easier to process due to lack wrinkles, my theory is that the 2000’s were simply times were fuel prices were low, thus shorts took a interest in shorting a company working towards cleaner energy such Hydrogen Fuel Cell.

Conclusion: Came across Ticker FCEL (Fuel Cell Energy) simple look at the charts reveal that on October 2nd, 2000 ( Possibly shorts covering from the DOT COM bubble) the stock rose to ATH $7421.94. Shows similar pre-sneeze price moment as GME back in January. 

But there is literally nothing on this on the internet, but I managed to scrap something quite interesting that might be relatable to GME considering the current hype for a Split/Dividend. 

[FCEL Split History](https://m.splithistory.com/fcel/)

Now my fellow retards it is a coincidence that a 2:1 split was done on 09/14/2000 before the stock the rallying to $7421.94 about 16 days later on Oct 2nd…..I think not 👀

Feel free to make this a bannable bet. Ps I can't really afford to do this but will stick to my word so here's hoping for something tomorrow, be it an RC tweet or an announcement. My first full paycheck will come next Thursday and I will post proof of the check amount and it being invested. I see this as a win win in the long run although in the short run its a win or lose situation for me. But fuck the short term imho.",4261.0,u7hrxh,2022-04-19T22:49:41Z,2022-04-19

All good still waiting but is coming with courier. And i tried to call this week to ask for the same service for my other account i purchase DRS through giveashare but when i cal CS GME dedicsted number is saying lines are closed and call between 830 am and 530 pm but the thing is it says that even when i call at those hours. I call another number not dedicated to GME from computershare but i didnt get any info as to why the number is doing that. Apparently my give ashare (purchase april 16) still not there but i would prefer to talk someone on the GME dedicsted number since they seem to handle requests more effi ie tly than regular computershare operstors. Any idea how long takes give a share to DRS? And how to make the first letter pain easier?

>Do you trust the reported FINRA data every two weeks on GME's short interest?

I'm trying to gather data on rationally explaining the motive behind everything we've found.  It's one thing to point to reddit and say ""look at how many people are here"" and then the price of GME and another to logically express it.

The more people I get to respond to these two questions, the more accurate I can establish a model given the overall population for the sub.

If it matters, I present downtown Chicago here soon and the more data I have, the better.  Gonna be 10 minutes away from Citadel, so this is about to get hella awkward.",43.0,u7fe9u,2022-04-19T21:00:25Z,2022-04-19

# Part 1:  Understanding the players.

**The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)** is an American financial services company, owned by Banks and Brokers, that provides clearing and settlement services for the financial markets.  

T**he National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC)** is a subsidiary of the DTCC.   The NSCC operates as a seller for every buyer, and buyer for every seller in the financial industry for trades that settle in U.S. markets.

**The Continuous Net Settlement (CNS)** System is NSCC’s core netting, allotting and fail-control engine. It is an automated accounting system that centralizes settlement and maintains an orderly flow of security and money balances.  Within CNS, each security is netted to one position per Member, with NSCC as its central counterparty. Within CNS, NSCC acts as the central counterparty for clearance and settlement for virtually all broker-to-broker equity, corporate and municipal bond and unit investment trust trading in the United States. 

CNS settles trades from the nation's major exchanges, markets and other sources and nets these transactions to one security position per Member per day. Cash dividends, stock dividends, bond interest, and mandatory corporate actions are automatically debited or credited to Members' CNS accounts with open fail positions. On settlement date, all trades due to settle are netted by issue to a *net long* (buy) or a *net short* (sell) position,

**Cede and Company**, also known as ""Cede and Co."" or ""Cede & Co."" (shorthand for ""certificate depository""), by Nasdaq definition, is the Nominee name for DTCC - a large clearing house that holds shares in its name for banks, brokers and institutions in order to expedite the sale and transfer of stock.  Cede and Co is a specialist United States financial institution that processes transfers of stock certificates on behalf of the DTCC.  Cede technically owns substantially all of the publicly issued stock in the United States. Thus, investors do not themselves hold direct property rights in stock, but rather have contractual rights that are part of a chain of contractual rights involving Cede. *\[*[*https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvspq/cede\_co\_the\_secret\_trilliondollar\_company\_that/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mvvspq/cede_co_the_secret_trilliondollar_company_that/)*\]*

**Brokers:**  A prime brokerage (PB) is investment banks and other financial institutions that offer a bundled group of services to hedge funds and other large investment clients that need to be able to borrow securities or cash.  A broker-dealer (BD) is a person or firm in the business of buying and selling securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers. The term broker-dealer is used in U.S. securities regulation parlance to describe stock brokerages because most of them act as both agents and principals.   
  
A brokerage acts as a broker (or agent) when it executes orders on behalf of its clients, whereas it acts as a dealer, or principal when it trades for its own account.  The services provided under prime brokering include securities lending, leveraged trade execution, and cash management, among other things. Prime brokerage services are provided by most of the largest financial services firms, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Morgan Stanley.

&#x200B;

# Part 2: What happens with the stock dividend distribution for GameStop's stock split?:

When a company declares a stock dividend the information is generally provided to DTC by the security’s issuer (GameStop) or agent (ComputerShare) in the form of an event announcement. This information is then sent to all clients of DTC’s Corporate Action Service (Brokers).  
  
When it is time for the stock dividends to be allocated, all entitled holders at DTC are sent confirmations communicating information associated with the dividend event. The message can feed directly into a client’s system (eg. Brokers) so that they can pay their holders (eg. Non DRS Apes) and perform their reconciliation process as soon as their account at DTC has been funded.  
  
The DTC is the ultimate 'record keeper' of the legitimate shareholders brokers have registered as holding GME in street name with Cede and Co. When GameStop / Computershare sends the confirmation of issued shares, the DTC facilitates the distribution of these shares for record holders and manages the Broker reconciliation. All shareholders not short the stock are entitled to the GME share split stock dividends.    
  
DD supports GME is heavily shorted, as well as having significant counterfeit shares hidden through manipulative derivative strategies.  Shareholders that bought these shorted and counterfeited shares *are legitimate owners* of the stock, and are entitled to the stock split share dividends.  However GameStop will not issue enough stock dividends for these positions - and it is the Brokers that hold the ultimate obligation for the stock split share dividends for their eligible shareholder clients.  At this time it remains unclear as to whether the DTC initially issues enough shares for all eligible nominee accounts to the Brokers and then *works behind the scenes for reconciliation with the brokers* \- or on the stock split distribution date, will some Brokers based on their net settlement balance receive an insufficient amount of shares / shortfall on the amount of shares required for distribution to their clients?  

Market participants who have borrowed and sold shares short are responsible for those additional/missing stock dividends, and will be on the hook to close their positions and make restitution to the Lender / Broker they borrowed from (in this circumstance this might be in cash or stock, but the end-game result is that at some point one of the participants actually needs to go to the market and actually purchase the shares to close the position). Same applies with bag holders from the sale of the counterfeit shares that are now held by clients in a Broker account.  

Addressing the Speculation:  If the DTC does not allocate enough shares for the stock split to Brokers by the stock split distribution date, some of the more nefarious brokers will have over-extended themselves and due to lending / shorting GME may be in a position of being unable to procure enough shares for their eligible shareholders.  In certain circumstances, some Brokers may have the option to payout in cash in lieu of stock on a declared dividend.  However, clarification needs to be made on whether this option actually pertains to a stock splits or only to declared dividends and not stock split allocations (Will the DTC allocate enough shares for the stock split and later reconcile short positions direct with the Broker?).

Note:  *For Tesla, we have not seen any reference to shares not being delivered*, or cash in lieu of stock awarded.  Tesla's squeeze happened over *several* months after the ex-dividend date, so I would assume the shares / shorts that were created from the legal shorts and counterfeits were being *reconciled behind the scenes* and closed during this period (or at least some of them). \[Remember, Tesla also had high short interest that declined without share price appreciation the year prior to their stock split, only to squeeze a year later with their stock split in the form of a stock dividend\].

IMO financially stable brokers would not want the reputational risk etcetera of not delivering shares.  However, in a worse case scenario, if a shareholder is allocated cash in lieu of GME shares, the shareholder could then buy GME with the cash equivalent (with negative tax consequences to having received the share dividend).    
  
*Stock splits (in the form of stock dividends) are not the same thing as declared dividends.  \[Please see my profile pinned post '**It's a stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) - not a declared dividend. Taking a look at what this means; Along with a look at charts from Overstock's digital dividend and the stock splits by form of a stock dividend for NVIDIA & TESLA**'\]:*

Interactive Brokers (IB):  To summarize, if by the record date of a dividend certain shares have not been delivered to IB, the Firm will be paid an amount of cash *t*hat is equivalent to the dividend amount  \[note: this happens when shares are leant out and the borrower provides restitution in cash instead of returning the share\], but IB will not receive a qualified dividend payment directly from the issuer. In such cases, the Firm will receive payment in lieu (PIL) and will have no choice but to allocate such payment in lieu to customer accounts. The firm first allocates PIL to those accounts who hold the shares as collateral for a margin loan. If, after PIL is allocated to all shareholders whose accounts are not fully paid, any portion of PIL remains to be paid, it is allocated on a pro-rata basis to each remaining client account.

# Part 3:  For those questioning whether market participants short this stock can just borrow more to cover or counterfeit more shares to prevent the price appreciation and squeeze.

&#x200B;

>(i) Keep in mind the current reported SI, lack of $GME liquidity, high borrowing costs and margin requirements.    
>  
>(ii) Consider the amount of counterfeit or synthetic shares that DD supports exists and is hidden through manipulative derivative strategies.

If the borrowed short positions and the counterfeit shares aren't covered prior to the ex-dividend date, GameStop will only issue a specific number of shares to the DTCC based on the split ratio to be distributed to shareholders. Assuming 7:1, they are issuing an additional 6 shares for every legitimate share owned. Multiply all of the legitimate shorts and more importantly the counterfeit shorts by a factor of 7. We are likely talking billions of shares that need to be procured overnight.

We are already at 100% utilization of shares available to borrow by lender (at a significant cost to the shorts). The stock split does not increase this amount available on the already leant out shares. Where and how will the additional, potentially billions, of shares to borrow come from?

GameStop's recent 10k shows the weighted averaged diluted Common Shares outstanding for GME at 72.6 million. Less: Institutional Unknown: 28,413,271 \[includes illiquid Mutual Funds & Pensions: 8,004,284, ETFs: 6,588,016\], Insider: 12,716,820, Shareholder DRS total: 8,900,000. This represents a remaining tradeable float of only approximately 22.5 million shares. \[Note this is a bit dated - pulled it from a prior post of mine\].

There just isn't enough shares in the system available to make this happen - too much volume to control. Plus consider the margin requirements to borrow this many shares. This stock will be under a microscope by apes and others, and the illegal creation of outright counterfeit shares in this volume would be traceable and well documented for court litigation - of which most prime brokers-dealers would outright avoid at the sake of (including but not limited to) reputational risk, potential jail terms and revocation/banning of future trading. There are simply too many shares to 'poof into existence'. Look at how the internalization of shares got away from them back in the Jan '21 'sneeze squeeze'.

Plus, there is a high probability that the lower share cost after the split will result in some FOMO. Options will be cheaper to purchase and exercise, and at least some covering of shorts is probable. Market participants short the stock are just digging a deeper and deeper, more costly, hole to bury themselves in.

I believe the Tesla stock split by form of stock dividend in August 2020 is a great comparison for GME. They had high short interest that miraculously declined without real appreciation of the stock price. After the share dividend, they squeezed - huge. GME has less outstanding shares, but less liquidity, and DD supports an extensively higher hidden SI. Apes have DRS their shares, and the liquid shares available to trade are miniscule.

Plus, IMP, I am a firm believer that RC / Gamestop have a secondary plan to eradicate the shorts. It may take some time, but as a follow up to the stock split I think there is a high probability that some type of crypto / NFT unit|dividend|token / digital dividend / spin-off related to their Marketplace will happen. 

'Checkmate!'

# Part 4:  A look at Tesla's stock split (in the form of a stock dividend) as a comparable for GameStop.

Short interest and borrowing fees on Tesla were considered high at a reported 7.10% SI to float and a 0.30% borrowing fee. Note GameStop's *reported* SI and borrowing fees are *extensively* higher. Current Ortex data shows GameStop reported short interest is at 22.21%. Cost to borrow 8.72%.

&#x200B;

[Tesla's 5:1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Announced August 11, 2020. Record date August 21, 2020. Ex-dividend date August 31, 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/k6vgsny1piu81.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49b109e648eb997a21f255bca5cec39d5bb023a)

Note, similar to GameStop, Tesla's short interest declined without share price appreciation the year prior to their stock split. After the dividend distribution, Tesla's shares squeezed over a period of several months. GME has less outstanding shares, but less liquidity, higher borrowing rates, higher margin requirements, and as DD supports - an extensively higher hidden short interest.

Tesla's reported short interest hit a May 2019 high of *only 43.66 million* shares shorted. GameStop had reported short interest of *over* *200 million* by FINRA report - [309.43% SI in October 202](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u2ylh7/never_forget_gamestops_short_interest_in_october/i4q9ep7/?context=3)0 and 220%+ during January 2021 'sneeze squeeze' (court docs).  

[Share price reflected is after Tesla's 5:1 stock split.  Multiply shares owned by 5 and then watch the price appreciation.  Zoomed-in to December 2020 - it kept running after this.](https://preview.redd.it/1hl1gv25piu81.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ad7face6b410bc66e5200ce5d9b9f29a36a7783)

But the difference between GME and TSLA is:
- TSLA wasn’t as shorted, so the losses for SHF’s to buy back and close positions were most likely not a catastrophic, **idiosyncratic** risk to the broad market. 
- GME is so shorted that it will literally break the market if the price rises too high and too fast. It is the one **idiosyncratic** risk to the entire financial system. 

Therefore: 
- It is in the best interest of the brokerages to **not** margin call/liquidate SHF’s and to possibly fake & internalize the split/dividend. It’ll be similar to buying shares or crypto on Robbinghood. You don’t own the shares or crypto, but they’ll just show you the correct balance based on how much you paid for. 
- for the same reason, it is also not in the best interest for DTC to liquidate Brokerages.

- As long as there are shares on the DTC system, the DTC, brokerages, and SHF’s can all collude to internalize everything.
- What that means is they will do everything they possibly can to either keep GME price suppressed, or increase their total collateral on their other assets by pumping the entire market. For anyone paying attention to the correlation of GME’s price and the S&P500, you would have noticed that They’ve been doing exactly this for months now. 

The only solutions I see are:
- DRS **all shares** away from DTC.
- GameStop decides to manually recall all shares off the DTC system and onto their own blockchain/NFT platform.",67.0,u7blcg,2022-04-19T21:40:20Z,2022-04-19

>	An ordinary dividend is a regularly scheduled payment made by a company to its shareholders. Dividends are the portion of a company's earnings not reinvested in the business, but paid out to investors as ordinary dividends, special dividends, or stock dividends.

A split dividend is not an ordinary dividend and I honestly feel any post normalizing receiving cash instead of shares is low key FUD.  If they can afford to pay cash for the shares then they can afford to buy them from the market.

Also, the IBKR link goes on to say that cash paid shares are required to be held segregated from shares purchased in a margin account:

>	**Payment in lieu of an ordinary dividend may be received when the shares have been bought on margin**, or **when the account has a subsequent margin loan due to borrowing money to facilitate the payment for additional purchases of shares or as the result of a withdrawal from the margin account**. Payment in lieu of a dividend may also be received when shares are owed to the brokerage firm and have not been received by the dividend record date.

>	To better understand the difference between an ordinary dividend and a payment in lieu, we will explain the steps taken by IB to comply with US regulations. Each business day, the Firm analyzes the positions in each customer account, every borrow, every loan, every pledge of shares for each security held by its customers to determine how many shares are held on margin and the associated margin loan balances. **For each security that is fully paid, we are required to segregate those shares in a good control location** (for example, a depository or a US bank. See KB1964).  **For shares that are held as collateral for a margin loan we are allowed to hypothecate and re-hypothecate shares valued up to 140 percent of the total debit balance in the customer account** (See KB1967).

Ensure your account is a cash account and you’re not on margin.  Since cash shares are segregated and ‘they don’t lend them’(they swear!) **you should in not receive ‘cash in lieu’** and should not settle for cash instead of shares either IMO.",10.0,u7blcg,2022-04-19T20:13:58Z,2022-04-19

If you split a stock then the option gets split too, but with them being dividends I would expect nothing to happen to the options. e.g. you own a call for 1/1/2023 and then dividend is one share and I would figure you would still own just a single call for 1/1/2023.

Not sure they brokers can make a undo TAX burden on hodlers ? This is what I believe will be the issue . I’ve found nothing ( and I’ve looked ) saying they CAN’T give you what the company is awarding ? 

No stock dividend but here’s cash instead you pay the taxes ?

So someone owns 10k for easy maths $10,000 x 7 =$70k. Investors pay short term gains 33% on 2022 tax forms .
So a loss of what $22,000.00 ? with no fault by us ?

Now if we held awarded shares never to be sold or when we chose to sell ? Then TAX will be paid , our choice not there’s?

4344,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,"GME now the top-weighted stock held by XRT. Used to barely crack the top 20. Means nothing, though, amirite?","Hmmm 🤔

ETF channel is saying XRT has a market cap of 540 mil, but 1.17% of that is $6.3 mil not the $2.9 mil shown in this post.

That discrepancy is odd enough, but also, I checked how much GME was in XRT a week ago, it was 55,000

This new weighting does not make sense to me, it seems like there is less GME now, as $6.3 mil would only equate to 42,000 shares

GME has probably had more significant gains than other stocks held in the etf. This brings the weight % up.

The ratio between the number of shares on loan across all outstanding loans in the wholesale market and the number of shares available for lending at lending programs. 0% means that no shares have been borrowed or lent at these lending programs; 100% means that all shares available to borrow or lend at a lending program have, in fact, been lent. This does not represent the number of shares listed on the exchange that have been lent, because not all listed shares are available for lending; it indicates how much of the supply actually available for lending has been lent.

They are trying to figure out how to keep their cash cow after the squeeze. There are 3 or 4 big players who might be working together to fix the broken system. They gave us a tentative timeframe. That May of been moved forth. Look for another post,if you don’t understand. They have a few moves left. We should be seeing them a bit more frequently. The fuse has been lit.

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",2339.0,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T07:00:11Z,2022-04-19

4496,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"So what happened this morning?

- the entire Market ripped upward while GME was being suppressed downward at Market Open
- Why? Because SHF’s know the price of GME needs to go up today for whatever reason (FTD cycles? Not sure. Something RC knows the timing of, hence last night’s tweet) 
- I’ve been saying for months now that SHF’s hedge against GME by utilizing the entire market’s movement. 
- If SHF’s are anticipating an upward price movement on GME, they **need** to pump the market first.
- Why? Because SHF’s shorted GME, every time GME goes up, the short position gets larger and larger. This means their balance becomes more negative. The only way to prove to their lenders that they can pay off the short position is to show that they have enough collateral.
- What collateral? Their long positions on other stocks. 
- So if GME goes up, You bet they will pump the market to stay solvent.
- what about a Marketwide selloff? Well then their collateral shrinks. They would **need** to bring GME down with the market


They will do this indefinitely until they can’t. As long as they have DTC shares to manipulate with, they are in control.

I’ve had a subscription to Netflix for almost 20 years.

I subscribed to Netflix because I was tired of getting hit by late fees from Blockbuster for returning the disk after 12:00 PM. Then they added streaming, which was a bonus.

I don’t require DVDs in the mail anymore. But you know what’s missing from my Netflix subscription now that I don’t get them? The ability to watch popular films shortly after their release in the theater. I almost always have to use another service for that.

Netflix isn’t competing in a field getting flooded with services: Amazon, Hulu, HBO, Paramount, Apple, I could go on, all about $20 per month each. I’m considering dropping it because it doesn’t measure up.",20.0,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T22:09:46Z,2022-04-19

4631,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"Price stayed dead flat for like 20 minutes on the German market.. Usually peek at that daily German market thread and never seen that much white before.

The post bot updates the price and volume every five minutes. The bullet points for each update are either a red or green square emoji to indicate the candle for that period. Well, I don't remember seeing white square emojis before and there were several in a row today. 

Does anyone know what this means, or if it could be significant? The periods have volume but no price change. I understand white candle = no price change, but can anyone look at other factors and see why the price went completely sideways for 20 minutes?

There was also lots of buzz about the price ""glitching"" and showing as $109 momentarily and then correcting back to the ""real"" price. Soon maybe there's something weird there too.

Will post this that I've written so far, and then edit in another second , with the link to the daily German market thread below.

EDIT : https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u6xzr1/diamantenhände_german_market_is_open/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

There's the German market thread for today.

There are 7 white (no price change) bullets out of 26 total points. $144.85 is flat with no change for twenty whole minutes? 

Volume during these periods is 2500 to 3500. While low and high volumes for the day are 816 and 4755 respectively. So it's not as if they have low volume causing lack of price change. The price is changing even at 816 volume.",14.0,u6yyuy,2022-04-19T08:05:32Z,2022-04-19

My average cost basis on these shares should be about 110 dollars.  I have 37 shares enroute to DRS and the cost basis is sitting at 150.70. 2 weeks ago i transfered exactly 100 shares that i had bought on the dip at about 88 dollars and change.  When those went to transfer, they had a cost basis of exactly 150.00.  I just got off the phone with them and the dude kept telling me robinhood this robinhood that.  Told him, dude im not dealing with robinhood and never have.  you guys have over a trillion AUM, why are we talking about some shit company i never used.  Told him, you guys totally excercised a 150.00 call option to fulfill the obligation of my 100 shares getting transfered.  All i get is uhhhh uhh uhhhhh, let me talk to the back office.

A market where the average American can invest in the companies they like and reap the benefits of long-term hodling and reinvesting both in itself, the employees, and the investors?

Is it too much to ask that the average person could just buy a handful of shares and not have to worry about those shares being used against them to ruin their investment and kill off good American companies?

What if I some day don’t want my cs-go game anymore but instead I want battlefield. A platform where I could trade that game (just like in the old GameStop store) would be so cool! It could be with a fee to cover and earn money for the business but damn that’s a good idea and needed.

4929,gme,Superstonk,POST,I left my job in September because of my conviction of gme.,"The real reason? I spent 8 years of my life dealing with customers and my boss, in a restaurant. I love my boss, he’s a mentor of mine, but he runs a tight ship and the stress of striving for greatness each and every shift for 8 years starts to drain you. There were more good times than bad times, but the bad times were bad. I learned a lot and was ready to move on in my life, I’m an actor and I’ve always dreamt of pursuing my passion full time — something that can be or seem unattainable without steady income, especially in NYC. So many times I was ready to take the leap of faith and leave my job, but could never muster the courage to do it when I thought about it logically. It just didn’t make sense. 

GME has given me faith. I am and have been utterly convinced since February last year that moass is inevitable. I’m not and wasn’t banking on it happening anytime soon ( *it’s tomorrow* ) before I left, but the pure conviction it gave me, actually allowed me to muster the courage to leap. It opened up a door I’ve been waiting years to open. 

I don’t live off my gme. Haven’t sold a single stock and haven’t needed too. I’ve picked up some random jobs here and there and found money where I wasn’t able to see it before. I also saved up a bit before I left and made some decent cry-pto trades along the way. 

I’m getting married in August, I’ve been immersed in acting and film work like never before, I’m producing a film with a public fundraiser, and I’m the happiest I’ve been in a very long time. I’d like to sincerely thank people of this community who are outspoken and take the countless hours to write up DD on our favorite stock. When I got into gme I was shitting my pants, but reading and staying up all night devouring all the DD I could really solidified my conviction for this. Thank you. You know who you are. You’ve played a part in my life, as I’m sure you have others as well. You’ve changed my life for the better. Seriously. 

That’s it really, I just wanted to post this because I have nothing of note to contribute other than buy, hodl, drs. I have my story, I have my conviction. I tell as many people as I can about gme and do my best to relay what’s happening. I’ve gotten alot of people on this train. 

 Best of luck to you all in your lives, although you won’t need it where you’re going 🚀🌕. Enjoy it, you only have 1. Proud to be an ape. 

*Buy, hodl, drs*

4934,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,I left my job in September because of my conviction of gme.,"*Sheesh* \- I thought I was alone in this.

I was a Senior IT Consultant and was with my previous company for six years... during half my tenor my company was acquired by a multi-conglomerate firm. Pretty much the usual story: a big company comes in, changes the culture and policies, and people leave. My immediate coworkers were great... my boss not so much. But, overall just *coasting* until MOASS kicked off. 

However, my last straw was my company's extremely pathetic attempt of giving me a pay raise. My next raise was set to be only *.5%*... this was after not receiving a raise the last two years. Our company was profitable between 2020-2021 :)

I made a calculated risk, abruptly quit my job in December of 2021, and have not looked back since! Been incredibly stressed-free and digging into my hobbies without the worry of time or schedule.

PS: Like OP, I do not live off my GME or LRC.  Still buying, holding and DRSing <3",6.0,u6ymxd,2022-04-19T13:11:38Z,2022-04-19

For me, I was addicted to doomscrolling COVID subreddits and US politics.   Superstonk helped get me fixated on something more positive after about 2 years of darkness.

4941,gme,Superstonk,POST,Why Elon Musk Will Never Buy GME,"##TLDR

Over the past few days I’ve seen a recommended [tweet](https://twitter.com/kyl0z3n/status/1514730018894712839) or [two](https://twitter.com/benjamino69420/status/1514782903770632201) encouraging Elon Musk to buy shares of $GME with the hope, seemingly, that doing so would be a MOASS catalyst.  While some might chalk this up to nothing more than a side-effect of recent Twitter theatrics, I think there are some less-obvious reasons — unrelated to being a [bullied billionaire](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u4jwqy/are_billionaires_or_wealthy_public_figures_being/) — that explain why **Elon Musk will never go full Ape and buy $GME**.  What seems more likely to me is that many of these billionaires *always have been* the public face of the behind-the-scenes bullies working against the interests of Retail Investors. 

##Background

My last due diligence [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s649s0/penultimate_peril_ark_invest_and_the_mechanics_of) from 3 months ago concluded with one key point — Credit Suisse and Nomura had Archegos exposure that I believed would expire sometime between late January and mid February 2022, resulting in forced institutional buying.

While this anticipation turned out to be a few weeks premature, there now seems to be a logical explanation as to why:

> “…an injunction that prevents Archegos’s creditors from forcing it into bankruptcy to try to collect what they are owed expires at the end of March.” - [Financial Times - March 1st, 2021](https://www.ft.com/content/96d549b5-31c0-4d24-9a57-dc58a203ec8e)

This was the first post I’m aware of that mentioned any kind of injunction and I suspect it’s what was used as justification by institutions (e.g. the so-called *[Plunge Protection Team](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/plunge-protection-team.asp)*) while selling billions of dollars worth of puts on 01/24/22 to pacify volatility when the $VIX eclipsed it’s 2021 high.

The expiration of the Archegos injunction was not the only interesting thing that happened towards the end of March. On 03/31/22:
1. $GME gapped up from it’s close of $166.58 to $188.90 during after hours trading
2. Citadel [redeemed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-24/citadel-to-further-reduce-2-billion-melvin-capital-investment) another $500mil of their 2021 Melvin Capital investment
3. u/Superstonk moderators posted [this](https://discord.com/channels/841716774554042439/914589091327246366/959224401776234556) message in the subreddit’s awesome Discord chat basically congratulating the community on being right!

While I believe Retail Investors successfully anticipating a major market event over the past year is an extraordinary achievement, I’m not sure all Institutional Investors feel the same way and I think the reason why has to do with one primary thing — ***leverage***.

##Hypothesis

> “If any one of the companies in the LCDX basket succeeded then whomever was being propped up by leverage from concentrated shorts would be negatively impacted (e.g. Ark Invest’s portfolio).” - [Me, 3 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/s649s0/penultimate_peril_ark_invest_and_the_mechanics_of)

This is the simplest TLDR explanation for why I believe:
1. Firms like Ark Invest, Tiger Global, and Melvin Capital are down 30-50%+ YoY
2. $FB experienced the largest one-day value drop in stock market history during February 2022
3. $SHOP, $Z, $DOCU, $TWTR, $NFLX and many others are all down +50% from their all-time highs realized during 2021 
4. Countless executives have either [stepped down](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/jack-dorsey-twitter.html) from leadership positions, [joined boards](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/31/shopify-ceo-joins-coinbase-board-of-directors/) of companies with overlapping investors, or [divorced](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html) their significant others

It’s the leverage gained through a securitization scheme dependent upon alleged [insurance fraud](https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/tokio-marine-accuses-greensill-of-fraud-in-tense-legal-battle-401516.aspx), quarterbacked by Credit Suisse in conjunction with Archegos and Greensill Capital groups, that ties them all together. 

While culpability obviously varies across involved parties, what’s now clear is that some behaved in a particularly heinous manner.  Take Ark Invest and their unironically titled report from 2020 titled the “*[Bad Ideas Report](https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/ArkInvest_101420_Whitepaper_BadIdeas2020.pdf)*,” for example.  The firm appears not only to have been advertising *against* the very industries it was extracting leverage *from*, but also to have been making investments *in* companies that would benefit by the failure *of* those they were advertising *against* — all with the support of silent whales like Archegos [pumping](https://www.wsj.com/articles/executives-wonder-if-their-stock-selloffs-were-linked-to-archegos-11618997403) their preferred companies along the way.

Elon Musk and $TSLA were obvious beneficiaries of this scheme and now appear to be frantically attempting to regain their edge after 10 years of uncompetitive and inorganic price discovery.  Musk’s latest gimmick seems to involve his best emulation of Ryan Cohen, treating the “Big Tech” companies as his own poisoned LCDX basket prime for a turnaround and blaming board members for their inaction, despite having personally benefited from the same toxic investment environment that lulled those very boards into complacency.

Which is why when Apollo Global Management [announced](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apollo-global-considers-participating-in-bid-for-twitter-11650313013) their interest in Twitter alongside Elon Musk earlier this evening, I was immediately reminded of his [friend](https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-goldman-sachs-gary-cohn-ready-to-step-in-for-lloyd-blankfein-1443657981) and former Goldman Sachs’ President Gary Cohn whose SPAC CohnRobbins is now taking Apollo-owned Czech lottery operator Allwyn Entertainment [public](https://www.ft.com/content/37a48ffb-59b4-446f-98f5-723f6864ddd6).  What’s interesting about CohnRobbins is that their CCO Robert Rasamny became the Melvin Capital CCO during December 2020, which I have previously [speculated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/r9g1q9/the_melvin_capital_misdirection_part_two_the/) was in relation to a *[private credit repayment](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/easy-exit-spacs-spell-quick-repayments-for-private-credit-63130191)* scheme in anticipation of Greensill’s loans losing syndication through Tokio Marine.  Rasamny has since been removed from the CohnRobbins’ website since the original connection was made several months ago.

This trail of breadcrumbs between Elon Musk, Gary Cohn, and Melvin Capital are major reasons why I believe this (since deleted) [tweet](https://imgur.com/gallery/wNIkt9c) by Elon Musk on Christmas Day 2020 is a major clue for those interested in the question of how and why the buy button was disabled in January 2021.  For those of you who don’t click on the link - it’s an image of shorts with the word “s3xy” on one cheek and the picture of a dog on the other — which I believe was a signal to short sellers to load up on a certain altcoin in anticipation of the pre-ordained disabling of broker buy buttons after Elon’s “GameStonk” tweet.  

I’ve long wondered if Musk knew short sellers needed a new way to collateralize their positions with the collapse of Greensill and found a way to do so through Robinhood, a company that: 
1. Was increasingly involved in the OTC markets throughout 2021
2. Has been heavily invested in by Ark Invest and
3. Is rumored to be a certain altcoin [whale](https://www.benzinga.com/content/24287928). 

So it felt all too coincidental when Robinhood was among several entities to [liquidate](https://www.benzinga.com/content/26311062) altcoin holdings on March 26th, 2022 (just a few days ahead of Archegos’ injunction expiration).

Seems like Elon Musk was complicit in taking money from less-savvy Retail Investors unaware their capital would eventually be used to potentially pay off debts associated with soured short sales. 

##Conclusion
These are the reasons why I believe Musk is not your friend in the way he’d like you to think.  He is no Ape, and I do not expect him to ever be a $GME whale unless it was part of a PR stunt.  I have serious concerns related to Musk and Apollo’s interest in Twitter, and suspect that neither are  fans of Ryan Cohen’s growing influence on the platform.

If you’re now wondering, “Wait… wasn’t $TSLA targeted by short sellers just like $GME?”  You’re right, they were — and that’s something to be excited about because its one of the reasons why I think $GME will just keep squeezing.  

Elon’s scheming and $GME’s short interest doubling over the past few months are, to me, incredibly bullish indicators and obvious signals that shorts have not yet closed.

5007,gme,Superstonk,POST,Broker Dealers & Mutual Funds/ETFs Have A LOT of GME Securities Lending Counterparty Exposure - Let's Explore Some Numbers (Funds 4 - 7 Added) - Why Are Funds Holding Shares of Exchanges? 🕸️⏰☎️💥,"Reposting from this morning. Not really sure what was going on with the post, but here we go, again.

**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**Update to Original Post:**

* Added onto the TL;DR
* I've added onto and clarified AIG's 2008 securities lending losses within this post to include information that funds, and borrower loses could be substantial worse for GME securities lending counterparties, and
* included new funds

**If you've read the prior posts and are just here for the updated funds, please proceed to Example 4**. Otherwise, here you go.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks/prime brokers) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs (funds). The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read as it shows the interconnectedness of the entities involved and how everyone, from the short seller all the way back to the shareholders of the funds loaning the GME shares are exposed to potentially catastrophic losses during MOASS, which is why I believe my shares are safest at Computershare.

Background Information

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

There are **two main types of securities lending risks**.

**The first risk** type is what AIG experienced as the collateral they received from the lent securities was reinvested in illiquid high-risk assets, including assets backed by subprime residential mortgage loans which lost value during the sell-offs.

In 2014, current SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce had the following to say; *Through the securities lending program, AIG and its life insurance subsidiaries had massive exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities. At the height of the 2008 crisis, the program experienced a run, and AIG could not meet the massive repayment demands.* ***The losses in the securities lending program were severe enough to imperil a number of AIG’s regulated life insurance subsidiaries. Before the bailout, AIG itself may have been insolvent.*** [\[Source\]](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/financial-markets/securities-lending-and-untold-story-collapse-aig)

In order to close a securities lending transaction, the fund needs to return the collateral to the borrower when the borrower returns the share, which would mean the fund would need to close some of its positions unless it has the collateral already set aside, which it most likely does not because **everybody wants more money**. Since AIG reinvested the collateral they received in dog shit wrapped cat shit, the collateral had lost a lot of value and wasn't worth as much when they needed to cash out.

If you want to get really technical on 2008 securities lending issues, check out [Securities Lending & Why Wall Street Sold 2.5T Treasury IOU's Last October](http://www.24hgold.com/english/news-gold-silver-securities-lending-and-why-wall-street-sold-2-5-trillion-treasury-ious-last-october.aspx?contributor=Eric+de+Carbonnel&article=2507793268G10020&redirect=False)

**The second risk** **type** ***relates to a worst-case scenario*** *-- when a borrower, such as a hedge fund or investment bank, collapses and is unable or unwilling to return assets to the fund. Let's use Fannie Mae (2008) bonds as an example. A fund accepts Fannie Mae bonds as collateral, and while holding that paper, its value decreases. The agreement calls for these securities to be marked to market daily, with any decrease in value covered by the borrower. However, if the borrower fails to increase the amount of the collateral, and does not return the borrowed securities when they are due, the fund now has collateral worth less than the value of the securities lent out, and it experiences a loss in its net asset value.* [\[Thanks Motley Fool\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/10/16/the-risky-business-of-securities-lending.aspx)

Thinking of that AIG example, funds are currently lending GME shares to brokers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold...

During MOASS, the [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar but worse exposure to securities lending risks then the brokers who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The brokers currently borrowing and lending GME have a similar but worse [exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) than what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic for AIG and its counterparties... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds loaning the shares are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** **loaning the GME shares** (ex. BofA owns 11.6M shares worth $3.3B, of IJH) So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds loaning the shares.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares of the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds hold shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the NPORT [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tpm5si/nport_gme_deep_dive_so_much_gme_lending_total/) I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

* **138** of **213** funds were loaning GME shares
* **70** funds lent out more than **90% of their GME shares**
* An estimated **5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan** (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending),
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) on the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund...
* A lot of funds loaning the GME shares are managed by the same list of entities who are borrowing shares from the funds

I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks later in this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this **fund's borrowers:**

[ Nearly $4B worth of securities on loan to these 24 borrowers ](https://preview.redd.it/5vydi3gnidu81.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8c816d285b57ea55a8efc58b95549e4cf161a26)

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out to hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is a **shareholder** of this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

[ Well, that's basically the same people plus Citadel ](https://preview.redd.it/h7nbskgvidu81.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e5d6b67e1d432298b44585a2f55b4feaa75fd9c)

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***borrower/lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

# But Wait... There's MOAR!

The fund has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the **fund's holdings:**

[ $40B worth of these securities are held by the fund ](https://preview.redd.it/cpw1348cjdu81.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=dec07f47a8ac272f8cda4695a12057910eb434da)

 

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

# The Counterparty Risk

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However,* ***in*** ***recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace***\*. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.\*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can’t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

**\[Insert dumpster fire meme\]**

Do you see the vastness of risks involved in the short selling process, especially if most of that short selling is naked short positions AND other hidden means?

Decentralized tokenized exchanges could potentially benefit from the fallout illegal naked short selling will cause the world's financial system 🤔

# fin

When short sellers are liquidated during MOASS, funds, fund shareholders, and fund borrowers are exposed to huge securities lending counterparty risks. The above information shows a small glimpse of the GME securities lending taking place and the potential exposures for everyone involved.

Again, these statistics do not include any information on rehypothecated shares, any other avenues of securities lending, or any form of short interest. This is merely the estimated number of shares on loan by some funds.

Every quarter of 2021, the NSCC has had this (or similar verbiage) to say regarding the Clearing Funds backtesting, *the largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a concentrated security* ***exhibiting idiosyncratic risk*** AND they didn't have enough cash on hand to cover the potential default of their largest member 5 times in 2021. This had never happened before. [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance)

*What's an exit strategy?*

**You want to get even wilder?** Go look at the main holdings and shareholders of **AGG, IGSB, & NEAR** to find out that **these entities are indirectly holding their own and each other's debt through ETFs.**

**Note 3:** If everything is starting to look like a web, maybe there is a hub? I feel it important to point out that A LOT of entities listed as borrowers or shareholders of the funds above, are also listed on the **W\^E\^F PARTNERS** [**PAGE**](https://www.weforum.org/partners#D) **including** [**BCG**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1512103363311243269?cxt=HHwWisC4nev_iPwpAAAA) **& the DTCC** along with a lot of other familiar faces, including [Ken Griffin](https://thefundchicago.org/who-we-are/board/kenneth-griffin/). Maybe there is a connection, maybe it is complete coincidence. When coincidences pile up though, it's worth looking into them.

**Note 4:** I am not a financial advisor and none of this information is financial advice. I am simply providing information that is publicly available.

Either no one believes us, or we are totally overblowing things without a full understanding of all the market mechanics, or institutions are ignorant, dumb, and willfully ignoring things. I mean, why would a non-Citadel insider (from the ape conversation again) care to protect Citadel and say “we are aware of it”. It’s not like they care about Citadel at all. So they have no reason to not believe us other than they think we are wrong or are going to lose or are scared to speak the truth. Are we really the only ones signaling the alarm?

Some thoughts on the R-funds (Retirement 401K funds) not being bought in by banks, are they the only ETFs that the banks don’t invest in? All the other example ETFs seem to be bought by the counterparts, holding shares of them, but not the retirement funds? Are the retirement funds being totally fucked?

>They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

The share you have at your broker is like a [matrioshka](https://c.tenor.com/jyB_HRqiiOMAAAAC/matryoshka-russian-doll.gif) (russian doll):

You may look at it and think you own the share, then you uncover the first layer and notice there is another ""owner"" inside, uncover the second layer and notice there's yet another ""owner"" of that same share, and so on and so forth. **SO MANY LAYERS, SO MANY ALLEGED OWNERS BUT ONLY ONE SHARE.**

Turns out, you don't really own that share my friend.

**The only way to remove all the layers and be the true owner of your share is by Directly Registrering that share to your name.**

5170,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What are the reasons people should keep any of their GME during MOASS?,"How many millions does one need?  After awhile I’d rather have an asset than more numbers in my bank account. 

As to buying back in…. How?  Many of us are never selling a decent portion of our shares. Any drop in price that is significant will be met with buy offers. So we will be bidding against the DTCC for shares that still aren’t sold. 2 buy for 1 sell means price stays high 

If you’re serious and not shilling consider the following strategy. 

Sell 1 if needed for runway money. This keeps you going for months. Maybe years. Pays off your debt. 

Sell 2nd for retirement money. Not Lamborghini retirement. Quiet nice retirement 

Any sales after are gravy. Maybe a nicer house. Car. Etc. 

At some point if you sell 1 at a time and slow enough you’ll have tons of money. Most of your shares left and frankly get bored of selling. 

Sorry. But your idea of cashing out all your shares at a certain price is the absolute worst idea. 

Sell these shares like priceless works of art. Do you want another $20 million?  Or would you rather keep the Van Gough. 

Vs selling them like $5 handjobs behind the dumpster at Wendy’s",3.0,u6oh9e,2022-04-19T00:00:25Z,2022-04-19

I have an absolute floor that is a lot closer to the 250 million than the others.  That's what will set me and mine up for generations.  That will be one or two shares, I hope.  

Everything else, I will hold.  I'll hold for the smoller apes than me.  I'll hold for the future of the company and to be a part of it.  I'll hold to see the financial terrorists go to jail.  But mostly, I'll hold to see who gets the high score.  Because *I'm a fucking gamer* and I'm playing to win or slap the ass of the ape who does.  

That's my exit strategy.  I'm not exiting.  I may poke an appendage out through a knothole if the price is right, but the rest of my skin stays in the game.

5178,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What are the reasons people should keep any of their GME during MOASS?,"Should MOASS peak then start fizzling back down to earth, I have 2 shares for sale, one in a Roth account one in regular brokerage. 99% of my total position is DRS and will not be sold.

On the flip side, if MOASS looks like it’s heading into the next galaxy, where there is no definitive peak, it just keeps on going and going and going past the gmefloor.com, I will then contact a private wealth banker to take out a low interest securities based loan and never sell the two in the brokerage.  If or when, the price levels down back to earth in the $1000 range or so, I will then DRS those two  remaining shares to the infinity pool. 

I prefer the second scenario because I won’t have to pay capital gains tax and I’ll never have to sell a single share. What’s an exit strategy???

Your customers are the ones making you the money. 

One reason this system is so fucked is because big companies have forgotten that. They only care about getting theirs, and they don't care if it comes from customers or investors. Actually, they probably prefer investor funding because they get paid without having to actually deliver on their promises. Execs walk away with a nice salary while the company goes mismanaged.

GME is doing it right. Their board members get a (comparably) small salary, but are primarily compensated through their stock. Security to live comfortably, so they can make educated risks in the company and grow their wealth that way. And, with so many customers direct registering, and LITERALLY TELLING THEM EXACTLY HOW TO TAKE THEIR MONEY WITH SUGGESTIONS, GME is going to moonshot even without MOASS. 

There is a sickness on Wallstreet, where a few people think they get to decide everything for everyone. Sorry, that video game company doesn't get to exist anymore. We need their real estate cheap so we can charge unaffordable rent to copy-paste burger joints. No, I'm sorry Wallstreet fucks. You don't own this country. All you are are a bunch of greedy middlemen who don't actually provide anything. You only act as a broker, taking fees and stock, and making risky bets because you are addicted to your lifestyle. It's time for your kind to die out. It's time for a financial revolotion.

Power to the mutherfucking players. Individuals run this shit. We don't need you to tell us what is good and what is bad. We can just vote with our dollars. Sorry you disagree.

7212,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,"18k gains in April (BABA, AMZN, TWTR)","[All aboard the gain train.](https://imgur.com/a/NBityhG)

About 18k in gains since the beginning of this month. Felt like I actually was patient with my entries and saw through the noise on these trades. Already withdrew 10k for Roth, boomer brokerage, savings, and taxes. This is more money than I make in about 3 months of work, so this has been awesome.

**BABA 4/8 115c +$2,375**

(Bought at EOD and got a gap up the next day, sold at open).

**AMZN 4/14 3010c +$9,532.50**

(Bought this EOD last week when it was near 3000 because I like round number psychological supports. Moved up to 3120 the next day. I could have held out for about 10k more in gains, but oh well).

**TWTR 4/22 46p +$6,060**

(Opened these yesterday because TWTR talk was at a fever pitch on WSB/StockTwits, which means it's time for puts. Through everything I read, there's no way Elon's making this deal happen, he's the ultimate troll. Massive red candle hit today, I thought my eyes were deceiving me and then I sold at 2:11 pm.)",10.0,u7ho12,2022-04-19T22:44:21Z,2022-04-19

I thought Elon KNEW the bid would be rejected so he could shrug and say “welp” and dump his bags onto his #1 fans on 4/20 and make out like a bandit with billions. 

Enter today, Apollo Capital sniffing around, 7% up on the day, and I’m scratching my head as my puts are going deep underwater. Maybe this is all going according to plan for him? Would an institution seriously consider overbidding Elon for this dumpster fire? 

Still thinking Elon is going to make out like a bandit after all is said and done. We have TSLA earnings, Apollo meeting, FED, CPI, and (of course) 4/20 to look forward to so I’m not gonna panic sell like a chump. So tell me your thoughts or that I’m goin broke I like the abuse.

Most powerful people want Money, Respect, and Influence. Twitter represents Influence.

Twitter represents the public square, if you control twitter you have enormous influence on what the public is thinking about. If you control what someone is thinking then you control them.

Elon understands this, some other big money players understand this, twitter employees understand this. It's now just a matter of how many of them are willing to convert their Money into (control over) Influence.

8548,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-19-22 SPY, APPLE, QQQ Daily TA","  

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it… SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&#x200B;

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. 

&#x200B;

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn’t any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",21.0,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.  It's one big conspiracy that will one day be excused as a preventative measure to prevent foreign countries from disrupting our markets after the 9/11 tragedy (or something else that pulls on our heartstrings).

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index.

9040,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"People are just spooked by the dip in user growth, if that shows an uptick at all, there's no way they drop below where they are right now. Unless they post absolutely massive losses related to VR. A young tech company trading at a 15 P/E is not normal at all. Their previous earnings showed they still have the biggest platform by a long shot, I don't see why anyone would just stop using them for that reason.

I also don't think you are giving the VR/AR business an accurate representation. I don't think all of these ideas are directly connected. Pretty sure the NFTs/marketplace idea is going to be implemented in their normal phone apps.

The VR business has more to offer as a revenue stream than just advertising so I think it's pointless to even entertain that as being why it will fail.

I'm not big on the VR idea myself, but I still think FB will continue to dominate large areas of the internet. If they keep getting negative feedback related to VR, they're going to scrap it. I don't think they die on that hill.",1.0,u6l454,2022-04-19T06:13:44Z,2022-04-19

Facebook is basically selling as a value company despite being a growth giant. Their main platform, Facebook, is decreasing in relevance as the primary social media platform. However, unlike Netflix, Facebook has a lot of very successful subsidiary apps that are printers. That combined with strong revenue growth, continued expansion into new ventures, and very solid fundamentals make it a very compelling long term option. Good luck if you send it on options.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index.

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn’t “manipulation” it’s just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

About 18k in gains since the beginning of this month. Felt like I actually was patient with my entries and saw through the noise on these trades. Already withdrew 10k for Roth, boomer brokerage, savings, and taxes. This is more money than I make in about 3 months of work, so this has been awesome.

**BABA 4/8 115c +$2,375**

(Bought at EOD and got a gap up the next day, sold at open).

**AMZN 4/14 3010c +$9,532.50**

(Bought this EOD last week when it was near 3000 because I like round number psychological supports. Moved up to 3120 the next day. I could have held out for about 10k more in gains, but oh well).

**TWTR 4/22 46p +$6,060**

(Opened these yesterday because TWTR talk was at a fever pitch on WSB/StockTwits, which means it's time for puts. Through everything I read, there's no way Elon's making this deal happen, he's the ultimate troll. Massive red candle hit today, I thought my eyes were deceiving me and then I sold at 2:11 pm.)",10.0,u7ho12,2022-04-19T22:44:21Z,2022-04-19

This is the biggest crime the country has ever seen.

GME was never meant to happen - just think of the companies that would be bankrupt right now had GME never occurred (too much money invested to keep the game going).

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn’t “manipulation” it’s just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

These are some of the biggest companies tracking the S&P, which is.... made up of the biggest companies.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index.

10083,qqq,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-19-22 SPY, APPLE, QQQ Daily TA","  

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it… SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91.

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170.

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night.

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn’t any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",22.0,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

Buying ETFs, disproportionate percentage of each dollar goes into main tech stocks. Also institutional money is required by regulations to do certain things and own and buy and sell at certain thresholds. Then you have individual investors that naturally clump in to cohorts making similar decision reflecting in the market the same (market participant psychology is what your seeing). Not so much mAniPulAtTion
Edit: institutional psychology is the same. They tend to end up grouping up in the same places.
Think about how matter is scattered throughout the universe. That isn’t “manipulation” it’s just concentration in certain places and those concentrated areas have synchronized movements because of rational decisions (mostly) made by participants analyzing all the same set of events",3.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T19:01:24Z,2022-04-19

These are some of the biggest companies tracking the S&P, which is.... made up of the biggest companies.

Unless there is a reason for them to deviate, they SHOULD move with the market (SPY is a great market indicator).

Edit: I'm being serious when I ask what is the indication there is manipulation and not normal forces? Give me any date in the past 10 years and I can line up similar charts with a random smattering of large cap companies compared to a S&P index. There's plenty of damning evidence of market manipulation, we shouldn't muddy it up with something that seems normal.",2.0,u74ssm,2022-04-19T17:55:27Z,2022-04-19

10196,appl,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-19-22 SPY, APPLE, QQQ Daily TA","  

Well that was the most boring bullish 1.61% day I have ever seen. SHEESH.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x6ljb5843ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=30a1e5009996fa7bbc564645ec2ffc7c75315ff2

As you can see the bulls this morning came out absolutely swinging and managed to take SPY from opening price of 437.86 all the way to 444.3 by 11am. Most of the upward bull swing was made within the first 45 minutes of the day though with some impressively large green candles. 

As you can see we closed ABOVE and well ABOVE the red bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xcsh3xt43ku81.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b345fa48e77df7e86869db0613be60f979aa6c

So yep you guessed it… SPY OFFICIALLY broke the bear channel started back on March 29th. BUT we have NOT made a new higher high until SPY  breaks that large black dotted like at 450. Once SPY breaks 450 I will officially call this a bull run. Until then we could be forming a wider bear channel. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iw2qdxb53ku81.png?width=744&format=png&auto=webp&s=471f6939e5131df16c424c56bd97408bf9d65fb1

Which looks something like this! 

This much wider bear channel gives us a resistance as I mentioned at 450 and a new support at 432. Now the one issue here is that Netflix just got absolutely obliterated on its earnings again (down 26% as im writing this). With Netflix posting a massive hit like that I worry that the markets are going to over react and take a hit here to price in terrible earnings. We have Tesla earnings after hours tomorrow and that will be the true test of what is going to happen with the markets this earnings season in my opinion. However, it would be naive not to expect a retrace tomorrow with this Netflix hit as we see right now -0.44% currently. Definitely will be something to watch intraday tomorrow. 442.7 provided heavy support today so that is definitely a level we need to keep an eye on tomorrow. As long as spy holds that (bounced off it after hours) I believe we will see green tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pf0coi063ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97057111bcce4b3e507b4e6554e79d929a1510d

SPY daily chart we are still in the bear channel as I mentioned until we see 450 tomorrow (if it comes). Right now the main take aways for the day was that the bulls managed to close Spy ABOVE the daily 8, 20, 50 and 200ema today after opening below all the EMAs. That is a VERY bullish finish today and will in my opinion set the tone for the rest of the week and next. The only bearish take away I have from today is that bulls were not able to close above the daily 100ema of 446.04. However, this close here gives us a easy spot to close above the daily 100ema tomorrow. The daily 8ema of 442.7 (at the time) provided support almost all day today and that is something I will look for to continue tomorrow with the 8ema closing at 442.91. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1f6eeqj63ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8701d9b4131fb199290bfdf86b8d30be77cf6fd

Apple had a bullish day today also but actually failed to break its bear channel on the 15min chart. This channel has a resistance of 168 tomorrow and support of 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xsd4pu673ku81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d525b6936b700ef73774b51c580f140de41bea97

Despite Apples green day it actually looks more bearish than SPY today. Apple failed to break its daily 8/ 50ema at 168.27 today. That is actually fairly bearish, however, bulls could argue Apple closed above the 100ema after trading below it for 3 days and now has an opportunity tomorrow to close above the daily 8, 20, 50 and 100ema. The goal for bulls tomorrow will be to close above 170. 

&#x200B;

QQQ of apple and SPY is the one I recommend going long on here, knowing it COULD see a small drop if earnings really are bad these next two weeks. I had my girl load up on QQQ today as I find it to be a great buying spot for it. QQQ is roughly 19% of its highs still and to me offers the most upside potential. 

QQQ as you can see broke their bear channel today. QQQ also was able to close ABOVE its daily 8ema of 345.35 today which is the first time if almost two weeks. The daily 20 (348.85), 50 (351.93), 200 (357.18) and 100 (358.06) are all now well within the grasps of QQQ if you can close above it. You can also see QQQ managed to hold a crucial support of 338. I mentioned the possible head and shoulders formed that would shoot QQQ back to 375-380 in the next few weeks. If bears are in control tomorrow they will attempt to close back below the daily 8ema again and also break it back near that 338 support line. 

Overall we are entering earnings season and now is a risky time to be holding ANYTHING over night. 

&#x200B;

Realistically besides Tesla tomorrow and SNAP on Thursday there isn’t any truly market moving (not that SNAP is) earnings to write home about. 

10% challenge-

Today was quite the day for me as I was able to make about 2.5x my daily profit goal today. I have officially secure my weekly profit goal already which is crucial since I wont get to trade Friday. I will look to continue to play conservative the rest of the week. The change to 3dte and a small position size so far has been great and successful. Below are listed my plays of the day. 

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3dte 20%

4/19/2022 Call (apple) 3 dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte 10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 3dte -10%

4/19/2022 Call SPY 1dte 13%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 5%

4/19/2022 Put SPY 1dte 10%

With the bull run today I was also able to roll my MES puts one time this morning and then end of day closed 2 for 50% and 1 for 30% profits. I did expect a small pull back which we got. I will at 6pm when futures reopen look to sell 3 more puts here. 

Total profits from the wheel are $538.53

Hyper wheel return= 1.8% 

Buy and hold= 1.42% hold (initial cost basis 4379).",19.0,u7geo5,2022-04-19T21:46:20Z,2022-04-19

10486,appl,Superstonk,POST,"""The Apple, doesn't fall too far from the tree."" Steve Jobs, in a short video, discussing ""Consultants"" lack of ownership leading to ""factional company value.""","Hello my fine fellow apes.  With all of the recent revelations surrounding consultants and their role in driving company value into the ground, I started digging deeper to see how far the distaste of consultants has spread across tech leaders.

We all know our very own RC has a HUGE distaste for Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and has made it VERY CLEAR he intends to *take them on* in a very public way. This got me thinking a bit. With his recent tweet about the apple falling from the tree (linked below), I busted out the good ole browser window and started digging onto consultants and Apple.

I quickly found an old Steve Jobs video where he offers his take on consultants and the lack of ownership/value consultants provide their ""clients"". (video linked below)

Almost foreshadowing the APE community, Steve uses a, ""Banana"" reference to explain his position a bit easier for the audience! 

Lastly, at the end of the clip...Steve makes a comment that instantly grabbed my attention.  Steve said, ""\[Consultants\] are a variable expense, and in hard times you find yourself....."" then there is crowd laughter before video is over.  Basically implying that when times are tough, you show them the door!

As Apples highest individual stock owner, it makes me wonder how much RC has been directly/indirectly influenced by Steve Jobs over the years, particularly on the consulting front....
