Seen this way too many times before. If you don’t pay yourself (cash some profits out) you will eventually find out you’ve been working for free. 

Doesn’t matter how good you are at trading - if you keep playing with more and more $ eventually you will get crushed by some random shit, and because you’re up so much, the moment things start going against you, you’ll probably refuse to accept it - cuz you know what you’re doing, right? - play more aggressive, and get wiped out instead of walking away.

I was literally shitting bricks yesterday at close. My normal principal for positions is 300-800. 1-2k is a big bet for me. 10k was like 20% of my portfolio. On margin.

I was trying to purchase just one of the 1015p when it was slightly OTM at 3:12. Etrade pro defaults to 10 contracts when you go to the trade screen to enter an order, and I was not paying attention to my order size when I entered the limit. 5 mins later, HUGE green shrek dicks ripped 3k off of my puts. I tried not to panic and asked if I would hold this position overnight if it was 1/10 the size it was. I would, and so I held the 10 puts. 

I did not waste a single second at open, immediately entered my order at 19 which was the bid price at open, and it was filled within a minute. Still shook over how lucky I got.",6.0,u3krtr,2022-04-14T16:04:40Z,2022-04-14

This strategy invests 100% in TSLA when the current price falls below the 200-day moving average.   
When the price rises above the 200-day moving average, the symphony shifts 30% of the portfolio into short-term treasuries. The symphony seeks to reduce volatility relative to TSLA while still participating in the upside.

1783,tsla,wallstreetbets,POST,TSLA Micro DD; The most condensed and valuable TSLA DD you'll ever need,"($12,000 GAAP earnings per EV sold) \* (20,000,000 EVs sold annually) \* (50 P/E) =

$12T market cap or approximately $12,000/share

Do I expect these numbers to happen? I dunno, doesn't matter what I think.. but you know what's important? The extraordinary potential upside for TSLA. I encourage everyone to use your own numbers. This DD will aim to educate you on identifying what these three numbers could become, and how to keep track of TSLA as an investment

1) GAAP earnings per EV

|Quarter|GAAP EPS|EVs Delivered|GAAP earnings per EV sold|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2021 Q1|$0.39|184,800|$2,361|
|2021Q2|$1.02|201,250|$5,671|
|2021 Q3|$1.44|241,300|$6,677|
|2021 Q4|$2.05|308,650|$7,432|

Your homework: How is GAAP earnings per EV going up? and How high will it go? These are not easy questions to answer. You have to dig. Check out ASP, gross margin and operating margin for Tesla, as well as their trends. Understand Economies of Scale and Wright's Law. Look into the innovation that Tesla is attempting in building EVs. Finally, every quarter.. do your math! GAAP earnings per EV = (GAAP EPS \* outstanding shares)/(EVs delivered). Use [ir.tesla.com](https://ir.tesla.com) as your source

2) EVs sold annually

This is the biggest risk to Tesla and most important thing to monitor imo: execution. Their goal is 50% growth in sales YoY. To be bullish, we have to see them hit that goal.

Homework: Do your math to predict sales based on 50% growth YoY, and watch to see if they achieve their goal. They sold 936,000 in 2021, if they grow at 50% YoY, what year will they reach 20M?

3) P/E

Unfortunately, there will always be speculation here. Tesla will likely always try to innovate and find new businesses to grow. They're currently focused on Solar and Energy, FSD and the Tesla Bot in addition to EVs. So long as there's new innovative business opportunities, what P/E value does that justify? Your homework is to make your own speculation here. 25 P/E? 50 P/E? 10 P/E? You decide.

&#x200B;

Lastly, use your own numbers! Decide if this upside is really there, and if you decide that TSLA could continue to grow, then you're now equipped with some nice metrics to follow and help you maintain conviction in your holding.

Happy rollercoaster riding friends 🎢",12.0,u373vo,2022-04-14T02:37:00Z,2022-04-14

While they refuse he'll be buying >50% on the open market at lower price,"Look he can just buy whether the board accepts or rejects. After a certain threshold all shareholders must sell up anyway. If he gets over 51% he should be able to control the business, however you'd need to have a close look at the articles etc as there may be different classes of shares with different voting rights and certain classes may call the shots irrespective of who holds what.",23.0,u3pdmh,2022-04-14T20:01:10Z,2022-04-14

While they refuse he'll be buying >50% on the open market at lower price,It IS an option they don’t seem to be considering in the msm. They’re focusing on him selling and tanking it but i think the wording was ambiguous.

7866,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Mark Cuban thinks Elon plans to sell $TWTR for a profit,"I think Elon knows Twitter is going to deny his offer. Once they do Elon will announce he sold his shares and Twitter will tank 50%. Musk will announce that he’s now buying MySpace or starting a competing platform. Twitter will tank some more. Once all of this occurs there will be class action lawsuits against the Twitter board for incompetence and not prioritizing shareholders. Musk will then expose Twitter for being mostly bots that are controlled by corporations and governments to disseminate propaganda. That will be the final nail.

Edit. 

Because people like this comment, I will clarify a bit about why I think this is a real possibility. 

THEY ARE FORCING HIS HAND if they reject his offer. He’s not going to sit on billions in shares of a dying company, who’s board just said no to an unbelievably good deal.

ELON IS WILLING TO BUY IT. He could easily revive Twitter. But he knows they won’t sell. Twitter will not sell because they are an asset of the deep state. 

Where it gets real.

Elon will start a competing social media. Half of the population will flock to It. While Elon and his platform are shunned by the other half. Increasing government overreach akin to Shanghai occurs. Elon’s platform is the only place to freely discuss it. Elon deemed a terrorist. Users of Elon’s platform deemed terrorists as well. US government pushing for civil war by various means; mass arrests, armed checkpoints, restricted travel, lack of food and water. While countries around the world offer to send soldiers to the US to quash the rebellion that isn’t actually occurring (a few shootings but no war). Iran, China and Russia side with the US patriots and make compelling speeches about liberty, but patriots are convinced it’s an act. 

On the brink of war a highly televised and very violent fake alien invasion occurs. One man distinguishes himself by seemingly supernatural means during battle with the aliens and through the subsequent days. I think he will speak to each person individually, like in their head. This will not really be supernatural, but part of a carefully constructed plan dating back decades. Nano tech currently being dispersed worldwide via airplanes, as self-assembling microfilaments (the cause of morgellions) will be the means by which he speaks to each person. I think this will happen while he’s giving a speech, after defeating the aliens in some way. This speech will be the most viewed live event in the history of television by a large margin. The job of each government after the chaos of the invasion will get the power back on and to get people in front of their televisions to watch the speech. He will say the perfect thing to each person (based on data collected from each person while internet browsing). He will then claim to be God (not the God of any earthly religions but the real one) and most will accept him as God (they’ve seen evidence). 

Check out revelations if you’re interested in the rest of the story. Thanks for reading if you got this far! It was fun typing. BTW there ample evidence for the Morgellions/planes/nano bot thing.",1547.0,u3mft7,2022-04-14T18:15:44Z,2022-04-14

7989,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Goldman advised Twitter not to accept $54.20 a share but they have a price target of $30 for $TWTR,"After the 2008 housing crash... does any sane person take Goldman Sachs advice seriously? How do they even have any credibility.  They have been kicking other tech companies to the curb too... see their rating history on AMD... if you took Goldman's advice you would be poorest fuck on the planet, the fact its a revolving door between Goldman and the Fed for Sr leaders should be ringing alarm bells.

Its basically open knowledge that they peddle poison pills intended to let them steal your money. I can't believe that re-animated zombie of a bank was bailed out by 10 billion tax payer money and has the nerve to tell us how capitalism should work. they got a bigger bail out, then the $2.4 billion fine they had to pay for the derivatives they sold in unregulated markets.

People voted with their wallets, Goldman's slight of hand scheme backfired, and they should have bankrupted or been sent into irrelevance operating a handful local county branches in some backward state. I am all for capitalism its supposed to work by killing off unproductive useless leeches. capitalism voted, this bank shouldn't exit. Socialism as always stepped in and printed them some money and has been driving up inflation since. No idea why anyone still does business with them.

And as a parting gem BTW.... they are selling unregulated derivatives on the price of crypto... through an arm's length subsidiary/entity so some things never change, can't wait for the next ""oh they are too big to fail""... you would be doing more honest business with a Mexican cartel, to be quite frank.",115.0,u3jf9h,2022-04-14T16:04:32Z,2022-04-14

8193,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Is $TWTR worth buying right now?,"Musk obviously likes the twat platform but isn't entirely happy with the way it's run. He's referenced those things even before he bought his current stake, and yet a lot of apparent wokesters are reeeeeing because of --reasons- that are just twanging off the loose rubberbands between their own ears.

Some of those dipshites are at Goldman Sachs apparently, now advising that his price is somehow too low an offer in spite of being around 15 a share higher than their very own sell price rating.

I think he genuinely wants to buy it. And take it private. Hard to say how a shareholder vote would come out, but I think he gets it in the end. So it could be a profitable trade given the last price I bothered to check.

Disclaimer: I am not a twit. I do not have an account on the platform, and I have laughed at it since it's inception and have only grown to hate it. I also believe that in spite of the opportunities to make it better clearly being far greater than the possibility of making it worse, Elon is probably one of the few people who actually could succeed in making it better.",1.0,u3ino6,2022-04-14T16:06:14Z,2022-04-14

8195,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Is $TWTR worth buying right now?,"Been reading a lot of claims that this is another Elon pump and dump, which kinda makes me giggle.  If you are certain that it is, then buy puts.   If you think it will be approved buy calls or shares.  Personally I think it is risky either way so sitting on the sidelines as a spectator.

On that note, I do think he wants it.  It is a mature platform with over 300 million active users (actually reported over 330 million but assuming there are a lot of bots).  If I was a betting man, which obviously I am since I follow this board, if his offer is accepted he will, like he has hinted, go private where the new board will not have to be beholden to the stockholders.

My guess is that Twitter will then survive, and thrive through an annual fee.  Why is this my guess?  Well, he has stated it.  The ad revenue model forces the platform to limit speech that he feels is threatened.  Now I know many will find this ridiculous, but he does not.  He has stated many times that Twitter is the modern town square and all conversation should be allowed.

What would the annual fee do?  Well, glad you asked.  It will make certain that those that Tweet are real, or as real as technology can ascertain.  Everyone that pays for the blue check-mark would have to provide a phone and payment option (or some combination of that).  It wouldn't be flawless of course, I am certain bots will pay for their right to be heard also, but it would become expensive for whomever wanted their bot army to march forward.  

Lets assume that it costs you $10 a year to have your blue check-mark and no ads.   This is probably on the low end but it is easy math.  We could then easily compute that the private Twitter would be making approx. 3 billion per year.  Good place to put your money if you can do without it for 10-15 years.  Let the blue check-marks pay for your expensive technology platform purchase and tweet away with whatever you want to say.",1.0,u3ino6,2022-04-14T19:21:56Z,2022-04-14

The text read: ""As I indicated this weekend, I believe that the company should be private to go through the changes that need to be made. After the past several days of thinking this over, I have decided I want to acquire the company and take it private. I am going to send you an offer letter tonight, it will be public in the morning. Are you available to chat? 1.

    Best and Final: a. I am not playing the back-and-forth game.  b. I 
have moved straight to the end. c. It's a high price and your shareholders will love it. d. If the deal doesn't work, given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder. i. This is not a threat, it's simply not a good investment without the changes that need to be made.ii.

    And those changes won't happen 
without taking the company private. 2. My advisors and my team are available after you get the letter to answer any questions a. There will be more detail in our public filings. After you receive the letter and review the public filings, your team can call my family office with any questions.""

8256,twtr,wallstreetbets,POST,Bearish on Musk buying TWTR? Here's what you can do.,"**TL;DR:** 

**Bearish on Musk Buying Twitter:** Buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40/share or less

**Bullish on Musk Buying Twitter:** Sell TWTR Puts for more than Strike Price - $54.20

&#x200B;

In case you haven't already heard, Elon Musk wants to buy twitter. ([SEC Filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001418091/000110465922045641/tm2212748d1_sc13da.htm))

The offer was stated to be best and final. Whether or not that's actually true is yet to be seen.   


Here are the obvious outcomes along with the probability based on yesterday's option open interest:

* Twitter accepts the offer. 
   * Shareholders are paid $54.20/share. 
   * Market Estimated Probability 65%
* Twitter rejects the offer, Musk stays a shareholder. 
   * Price has a small dip, but is otherwise flat.
   * Market Estimated Probability 15%
* Twitter rejects the offer, Musk dumps his shares.
   * Price falls back to pre-Musk levels.
   * Market Estimated Probability 20% 

Market is currently pricing in a \~20% chance of scenario 3 happening. I think that probability is higher, especially considering how volatile Musk can be. 

I recognize there may be new option buying to reflect the new probabilities. I can check that after \~5pm NY time and adjust my position on Monday. 

Implied volatility for the April through August strikes are very elevated, which reduce potential risk/reward on the play.

So, I'm looking to buy TWTR Sep 42 Puts for $4.40/share or less as I think there's a better than 20% chance that Twitter rejects Musk's offer and Musk sells his shares.

For those who want to inverse me, you can sell Puts for any strike above $54.20, so that you can collect the premium, and the proceeds from the acquisition price of $54.20",57.0,u3g5u7,2022-04-14T12:15:12Z,2022-04-14

Why do I care what other people think about what I think? Why do people feel the need to let everyone else in the world know your personal and private business?

Such a strange era during my lifetime, and seeing today's kids that think life , real life, is some reality show.  I feel sorry for the future, glad I am on the back side of life.

Musk has hired Morgan Stanley as his adviser for the takeover. The offer price also includes the number 420, widely recognized as a coded reference to marijuana. He also picked $420 as the share price for possibly taking Tesla private in 2018, a move that brought him scrutiny from the SEC.

8459,twtr,stocks,POST,"Elon made a take-private offer to Twitter, he offered $54.20 per share, will TWTR continue to rise?","According to reports, in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today, CEO Elon has submitted a non-binding take-private proposal to Twitter on April 13, 2022, to be acquired for $54.20 per share in cash It does not yet own all of the issued common stock of Twitter.

The offer represents a 54% premium to Twitter's closing price on January 28, 2022 (the previous trade before Elon began a massive purchase of Twitter shares), and a premium of 54% to Twitter's closing price on April 1, 2022 (before Elon publicly bought the number of Twitter shares publicly available). a trade) at a 38% premium to the closing price.

Twitter said in its SEC filing that the proposal is not binding, and even if the two sides agree, the deal would depend on a number of other factors, including:

1) Receive any required government approvals;

2) Confirmatory legal, commercial, regulatory, accounting and tax due diligence;

3) Negotiation and implementation of the final agreement;

4) Complete the expected financing.

Twitter also stressed that there is no guarantee that a definitive agreement on the proposal will be signed, executed or completed. It was also uncertain if or when Twitter could respond to the proposal, nor a timetable for implementing any final agreement. At the same time, Elon has the right to withdraw the proposal or modify the terms at any time.

If the transaction eventually closes, Twitter's common stock will have its registration terminated under Section 12(G)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, Twitter said.

Recently, Twitter has been in the spotlight because Elon has become its largest shareholder.

According to a SEC filing last Monday, Elon owns 73,486,938 Twitter shares, or 9.2 percent, making him Twitter's largest shareholder. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal later said he would appoint Elon as a director of the company.

Elon responded by saying he would accept the position. ""I look forward to working with Agrawal and the Twitter board to make major improvements to Twitter in the coming months,"" Elon said!

Subsequently, Twitter employees and some industry insiders expressed concern that Elon would change Twitter's corporate culture. Earlier this week, Elon said he was no longer on Twitter's board

Analysts said at the time that this could pave the way for Elon to buy Twitter. Elon is barred from acquiring more than 14.5 percent of Twitter after joining the board, according to an agreement Elon reached with Twitter, a provision designed to limit his influence over Twitter.

But since Elon is no longer on Twitter's board, the 14.5 percent limit will also be lifted.",0.0,u3t7tm,2022-04-14T22:32:01Z,2022-04-14

They provided a contact number along with terms of the buyout. They required 50% plus 1 share for the deal to go through. I took the offer by tendering my shares by telling my broker as they all received the offer too. 
The companies intentions were to take it private and fire all management.  Believe me the management was pretty bad, but the patent they had was the prize. 

I am assuming Musk will do the same if he tries a hostile takeover,  but the issue is he would need 50% plus 1 to take it over. The company I invested in had huge dilution and debt as management sucked even though they had a very good patent. I'm not sure on Twitters shares as he would need to convince a big stock holder to sell to get control and I just don't see it happening.

I think by now he’s heard about DRS and knows how dark pools work in allowing phantom shares to trade.","With the news about Elon musk thinking about twitter, what if he just buys the float of TWTR, DRS and then show the world via twitter. He could fuck shorts which I think maybe some have been after twitter. 

Technicals of twitter look great, after my class I’ll post the technicals which are very bullish on all time frames. Not to pump it, no investment is GME. 

I swear I’ve seen excel sheets showing insane numbers of FTDs and shares traded in dark pools of TWTR, probably retail buys rerouted in order to suppress some sort of retail financial support of twitter from having an impact on the price discovery of the share price. 

I only hold and DRS GME. 

Hear me out, Elon could amass the whole of twitter in a day and it would probably (knowing what we know about order rerouting due to PFOF) get shifted onto dark pools and barely picked impact the price Discovery of the stock.

Imagine Elon bought all of TWTR in the open market, and promptly proceeds to show the world on twitter that he DRS’d the whole company. showing the world this would cause huge price spikes and

Short squeezes, gamma squeezes financial market insanity would ensue, Elon could once again be the destroyer of 🩳.

the already weak shorts because of GME, are faced to close that TWTR position and miss margin on GME? 

Big boys get fucked and maybe when it rains this time it gets hit with what’s been coming this whole time. 

Or even dumber would be if he DRS TWTR same day as Wu-tang album NFT wallet dividend gets announced.

RC YOU GON’ GIVE US THAT WU-TANG ALBUM. 

FO’DA’ CULTURE.

8631,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,Quick Gamma analysis of $SPY,"  Quick market run down for those awake before the bell

$SPY

Gamma Environment: Negative (-1.2bn) 

Key Gamma Levels:

14th

450 - R3 resistance

447 - R2 resistance

445 - R1 resistance

442 - S1 (First Support)

438 - S2 (Second Support) 

435 - S3 (Third Support) 

Views:

\* Following the 80 point rally from the lows yesterday we noted that that the remaining strength despite a high PPI print as mentioned yesterday would likely be as a result of charm flows going into the market from MOPex. Using historical data on Opex without understanding the context of positioning automatically provides limited info on actual movements that are to be expected. 

\* Based on macro conditions we do not expect natural buyers to exist and with negative seasonality appearing we do not expect bounces to be maintained.

\* VIX levels based volatility range of +1.3%/-1.3%, Negative gamma environment volatility is likely to continue to be more volatile than the prior week given the switch up in positioning. 

\* SPY remains in less negative territory across the board (both short and long term) (now at $-1.2Bn, down from -$1.8bn yesterday looking two months forward). This has normalised the current levels for this this year, we can expect volatility to maintain and should also expect ranges on either side of the equation but a natural trend higher remains as the final parts of inventory are cleared. See gamma results in the discord to view peak positioning. We continue to maintain that the natural trend still remains lower and based on analogues May seems to be a reasonable point at which we reach a bottom. (There remains a LOT of cash on the side lines that is yet to be deployed). 

\* Call volumes +12.8% and put volumes +4.97% with puts now only \~2x the volume of calls, following a peak call/put volume disparities. This tells us that the hedge is now coming full circle and as a result given the 

\* 10 Delta Put premiums (455C) vs call IV (at the 10 delta, 435P) is 1.5x in the short term and 1.6 xacross duration an IV basis, the skew here suggests that on the short term basis puts aren’t favourable. They do however remain more favourable beyond this week. Additionally this vol isn’t the highest read we have had thus far, with 2x presenting very strong risk reward. IV skew blows out below 425 and with the tails now currently offering an asymmetric return for those involved in the options market. Flows pushing lower should likely slow. 

OrderFlow

https://www.tradingview.com/x/yfPjlxNP/

For order flow perspective levels please see the levels provided in the chart. See these lines as “barriers” to overcome and if done then price can be “accepted” into areas where previous buyers (Navajo white = up volume) and sellers (purple = down volume) wanted to engage up until points where there are much greater levels of volume. These are areas that you can consider as greater points of resistance.

Calls/Puts Volume

https://www.tradingview.com/x/F4PHUd9Y/

🐂 Scenario 

Above 4444 (with continuous bid at 4460) ($ES) additional call buying to increase up the chain at further expiries and up the chain would be needed to continue this drive up. Note the skew toward call buying has lightened again but below we have a large delta of puts are set to unwind today which can give room to a bounce. We need put buying in further duration to lower and call buyers to move higher. Continuous exhaustion @ 4444 (we are at 4419 as of writing - having found repeat support at 4454) in the first 30 mins defines whether there is a clear aggressive direction and a move above could set us up for a hold above 4580 should positioning continue to drive higher. VIX crush below 18 will also help produce the environment we expect.

🐻 Scenario

If we maintain below 4400 in particular we’re interested in further sell off as this level provides a key level down. That being said this remains a strong floor and looks unlikely to break where we assign a 17% probability of this breaking. A break below this could generate sell down to 4300 as Vanna flows above drive us lower and with put gamma at 4350 and below increasing exponentially. This begins to act as a magnet to price with selling intensifying from above and below. We would need to see call buying decline in AAPL/TSLA as well as semi weakness, very important as TSM has just reported upward guidance. VIX maintaining over 22, new highs with VIX combined with ES new lows 22 which adds credibility to increased sell. We would also need to see some weakness in big tech, in particular we note AAPL, TSLA, MSFT as these remain the key drivers of the prior rally particularly and strength in gold miners and other precious metal cos (NEM, GLD,SLV etc)",14.0,u3h65i,2022-04-14T13:08:31Z,2022-04-14

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps… 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it’s the roaring 20s again…

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t3s9ml37ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=caae03fb35e40ce7d87b6e44177c9523ad875915

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ec85a98ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6536fb69f982d3b1953e249887f471e25f9509e

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9gyfddp8ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e38157a204b956632b698a1e2b2cf5100e80d564

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uv62879ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=68d8dcb465098b551f8c4f7fb36d1f9d3bfd5bbc

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lp9tapp9ydt81.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=76b08aaafc4107a52badba56b1940331f26be44c

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",45.0,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

Saving y'all a click:

One night earlier this year, AIG Global Investment Corp. hedge fund investment executive Norman Chait found himself sitting between Citadel's risk arbitrage head, Alec Litowitz, and a trader from another major hedge fund at a dinner sponsored by Morgan Stanley. ""When the other trader was turned away, Alec talked to me about business,"" says Chait. ""When the trader would turn in our direction, Alec would immediately start talking about kids' videos. This went on all night.""

When pressed, Citadel's partners were no more revealing with this magazine. But interviews with traders and a review of the firm's offering memorandums and investor letters does provide a glimpse behind the curtain.

The firm applies 15 strategies, but about 85 percent of its profits in the past few years have come from convertible bond trading, risk arbitrage and other event-driven strategies, say investors. Convertible bond trading and similar equity derivatives trading account for more than half the firm's profits.

Global in reach, Citadel, which uses leverage aggressively on certain positions, has built up big holdings in Japan; at times these have amounted to more than 70 percent of the firm's convertible positions.

Up 12.6 percent through the end of July, Citadel has outperformed many rivals because it steered clear of the hard-hit telecommunications sector. In risk arbitrage and event-driven trading, one of the firm's coups this year was making money on the failed General Electric Co.-Honeywell International deal, which caused considerable losses for many risk arb units.

The firm has occasionally stumbled. In the late 1990s Citadel amassed big positions in the equity-linked derivatives issued by money-center Japanese banks, hoping to take advantage of mispricings created by the unusual complexity and giant size of the offerings. But the trades soured. The firm scrambled out after suffering a loss of 2 percent in one month, but the same securities became a big moneymaker for Citadel in the next two years. ""We respect them a lot,"" says Louis Salkind, managing director of archrival hedge fund group D.E. Shaw & Co. ""They are certainly one of the top players in the world of arbitrage. We cross paths with them all the time. They are huge.""

Citadel has become increasingly aggressive in private placements, including the exotic field of Pipes, private investments in public entities. Over the past six years, it invested in 80 private transactions worth $550 million in public companies, according to DirectPlacement, a San Diego investment bank specializing in the area. Many of the Citadel deals, in companies such as MicroStrategy and eToys, had a reset provision allowing the company to convert at a lower price if the stock fell.

One variety of these convertible securities, known as ""death spirals,"" has no floor on the conversion price and has become increasingly controversial. These securities get their name from the combination of the investor's right to short the stock and the right to reset the conversion price, which creates a potential incentive for holders of the securities to push down the price of the stock. In January 2001 Providence, Rhode Island, telecommunications company Log On America sued Credit Suisse First Boston and two funds controlled by Citadel, charging that they had caused the firm's stock price to collapse, from $17 to less than $1, by engaging in short-selling after buying death-spiral converts.

""We are alleging that they bought the security with the intent of manipulating the stock,"" says David Paolo, CEO of Log On America. Paolo says Citadel engaged in ""massive"" short-selling, but Citadel, which declines to comment, bought only $3.75 million worth of the convertibles. Citadel is also enmeshed in a small investment in a company whose recent history seems like a bad movie. Soon after Citadel loaned $25 million to a Florida casino cruise company called SunCruz Casinos, a previous owner was murdered while driving down a Fort Lauderdale street by someone firing a gun from a black Mustang. The Miami Herald then printed allegations that one of the new owners, ex-Dial-A-Mattress franchisee Adam Kidan, had made ""food and beverage consulting"" payments to a caterer with alleged mob connections. Fort Lauderdale homicide detective John King says the murder remains unsolved and Kidan is not a suspect. The Citadel loan is still performing, but the profitable SunCruz filed for Chapter 11 to deal with a blizzard of lawsuits. Kidan, who has since left the company, has said the payments were legitimate business expenses. He did not return a message left with his attorney.

Citadel won't say how it fared on private placement investments in other fallen companies such as eToys. But, says DirectPlacement president Brian Overstreet, ""I think they made a lot of money from these other transactions because they were around long enough for them to trade out. But it's impossible for anyone to really know how they did.""

That's just how Citadel likes it. - H.L.",77.0,u3qm9z,2022-04-14T21:24:07Z,2022-04-14

“As a result Andersen Consulting changed its name to Accenture on New Year's Day 2001 and Arthur Andersen meanwhile now having the right to the Andersen Consulting name rebranded itself as ""Andersen"".

Perhaps most telling about who won the decision was that four hours after the arbitrator made his ruling, Arthur Andersen CEO Jim Wadia suddenly resigned. Industry analysts and business school professors alike viewed the event as a complete victory for Andersen Consulting.”

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps… 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it’s the roaring 20s again… 

&#x200B;

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t3s9ml37ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=caae03fb35e40ce7d87b6e44177c9523ad875915

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ec85a98ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6536fb69f982d3b1953e249887f471e25f9509e

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",44.0,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

In April 2020, I bought 100 shares of AMZN at $1900. Holding until November of last year, I sold all AMZN shares at $3,500. The main reason is that Bezos sold AMZN stock.

&#x200B;

To be honest, the market has not been very good recently, and I think many people are worried about whether the stock market will crash again.

In early May, the Fed will raise interest rates again. With a rate hike of 50-75 basis points said, the market could again have unpredictable results.

I'm a conservative person, I wait for the market to drop and buy on dips. Another question was raised, so how much will the market fall, and what price range is better to buy in the future?

I think we can have a good discussion on this issue.",16.0,u3ffvw,2022-04-14T11:36:24Z,2022-04-14

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps… 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it’s the roaring 20s again… 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zhw0gco3ydt81.png?width=825&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bb99893e214393da1508cf0b3d7d9515131bead

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too.

We have quite the candle forming on the weekly also with very bullish tendencies to that for the following week. If bears cant get the close tomorrow back under 440 bulls just might get back into control. But it is noted bulls failed to break the weekly 8ema at 444.71 and weekly 20ema at 446.22 which are both important resistance wise. 

Tomorrow key close levels is the daily 100 ema at 446.4 and the daily 200ema at 440. Which ever way we close will signal whats to come next week. 

Today was also the lowest volume day of the week so far. 

Going into monthly options expiration tomorrow we have the following OI:

430P- 76k (massive drop from I believe 1105k yesterday)

435p 49k

440p 77k

450c 62k 

445 38k

As you can see the most OI still favors the put side tomorrow. However, I highly doubt we see 430 as that would be over -3% red day (which I mean is not technically impossible but VERY improbable)… we are more likely to see a -1 to -2% red day at max (if we are bearish) which would put us right near 435 to 438 which lines up with the 435p and 440p… There is a significant amount of OI at those 450C though and 445C. I wonder if we would see a pop to 445 tomorrow and then sell off into the end of the day and end around the 440 mark. 

Just out of curiosity for the next MOEX the highest current OI is 410P 71k, 420p 83k, 430p 71k, 440p 52k…. 450 26k, 460 32k, 470c 41k, 480c 27k… even looking another month out the market is positioned with a higher bearish conviction than bullish. With those 4 strikes having 277k P to 126k… that’s nearly half the volume of calls to puts which I do find interesting.

Apple too saw quite the bullish day actually extending up over its probable IV movement of $3 today and closed ABOVE its improbable IV based move at 170.24. The close of 170.4 is a very key close for Apple. 

Todays volume on apple was the lowest volume since March 17th. Overall low volume day all around it seems. 

The interesting thing about todays movement for Apple is that it hit 171 and saw 5 rejections in a row followed by one more during power hour. That 171 level is a key resistance for apple to break. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7a83ixq7ydt81.png?width=759&format=png&auto=webp&s=e319c55f90f137144612510f5d7b93677c120663

With Apple too breaking its bull channel here is a corrected channel to watch for. 

Apple closed ABOVE its daily 20ema at 170.23 (will look if close gets adjust end of day though) but BELOW its daily 8ema at 170.48. I will be watching tomorrow to see if the 8ema continues to be resistance and if 171 rejects again. If 171 holds firm again I will look for a close near the daily 50 ema at 168.57. 

&#x200B;

AMD had a strong day today of course because of the upgraded price target on NVDA rallied semis… a little SUS if you ask me that AMD and NVDA both got downgraded last week only for NVDA to get upgraded again… definitely odd. 

Interestingly enough AMD failed to reach 100 day in a seemingly possible target for the day. 

AMD is still well below its daily 8ema of 101.62 with a failure to touch it since March 31st. AMD still holding below its key 100 resistance line now too. I will look for bulls to test that 100 tomorrow or break it down back near 96 to end the week. 

&#x200B;

Ford with a fairly uneventful day today with another failed daily 8ema retest. I will be looking for some sort of move here soon from Ford. Upside channel potential to him $16 tomorrow or break back near $15. Earnings coming up in two weeks for Ford will be interesting to see how it shakes out.

QQQ the only one today to maintain its bear channel but that was mostly due to the wide range that QQQ can trade within. QQQ also with an inside candle today and failure to reach a reasonably attainable daily 8ema at 349.34. 

Tomorrow its important for bears to prevent a close above the daily 8ema and of course important for the bulls to get this close back above the daily 8ema tomorrow and closer to 352 to 355 above the Daily 20 ema (351.46), and daily 50 ema (353.3).

Today was a great reminder why no matter how strong my conviction is I don’t like to hold positions over night… 

The 1dte apple put I consider burnt beyond repair. With a true red day I will be able to salvage 50% most likely. I purposefully swung small positions sizes for these knowing this could happen. 

The 16dte apple put does have a chance and will be watching for tomorrow close points to decide if I take the L or let it ride for the week. 

AMD I still hold strong conviction unless we close above 100 tomorrow. 

Ford still strong conviction till daily 8ema gets closed above and $16 is broken. 

SPY 5dte we could see some downside but most likely this one is burnt but I want to see how tomorrow shakes out first. If we get a fairly red day I may get some salvageable recovery there… but depending on tomorrow I may let this one ride.

Again all four of these positions I entered and knew they could and probably would go to zero. When I do swings they are never something or amounts that will cripple me. Of course any loss is not fun but we have to have smart position sizes. 

10% challenge- 

Today was one of those days for me where despite seeing a clear bull trend in front of me I just did not have the conviction to trade the trend today. The VIX was in clear down trend all day today and that very much so was a hint of what was to come but I very much so struggled the conviction to believe in this bull run when I factor in the macro data. With the worst PPI in history, worsening CPI and overall inflation out of control with the war, gas prices, recession fears, etc. etc. I have a hard time believing the bulls could do it today especially after the massive bull run yesterday got yanked hard mid day. 

With that being said I made 4 trades today.

One 0dte call that I tapped out at -15% (again no conviction and that ended VERY green)

One 1dte call for 10% 

One 0dte put for 7% 

One 0dte put for 8%. 

Overall today I made half my daily goal but obviously with factoring in the above loses from my overnight puts I am obviously in the red unfortuatenly for the day. 

Today was one of the days where I traded only about 1/3 of my total buying power which is a rarity for me as I had very little conviction in anything market wise. I will be interested to see what after hours/pre market look like and what tomorrow does with monthly options expiration being that there are so many OI puts left in the 430 to 435 range. We could see a fairly impressive dump tomorrow or those may all get burnt to a crisp and we could hit 450. The possibilities for tomorrow is endless to be honest. 

But today is one of those days where as a trader you have to step back and remember the psychology of trading. If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",38.0,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

Well the bears got squashed today after their big win the last three days. A turning of the tide? Perhaps… 

With the worse PPI data in history its only natural that the bulls would rally like it’s the roaring 20s again…

Today was actually a massive win for the bulls. They broke the week only downward bear channel we have been trading within. Granted they only closed two candles outside of it before falling back into it after hours… its still a break and that’s a big momentum shift. So where do we head from here? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/urb0tm35ydt81.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c65171a4383a2e16041e3022404f03a5b1c0c7

As you can see our red bear channels broken… lets see if we can find a new trend or not…

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rki1ivp5ydt81.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd2ceb0c8f0db13436ecaf7fc574a2fed00cace

Overall this is the new channel we are trading within now. Its not perfect yet but its something to keep our eyes on as time goes on. Right now the big take aways on the daily chart is that we closed back ABOVE the daily 200 ema that is at exactly 440 now. After back to back closes below the daily 200ema a close above it is a bullish shift in momentum for sure. However, bulls failed to breach or even test the daily 50ema at 444.88 or the daily 8ema at 445.17 both of which will now be big resistance back to the upside. If you can see the 8, 20, 50 and 100 EMA are all stacked in about a $1.5 range. All of those will provide hefty resistance for SPY to break through. 

You may be asking what the 4 blue arrows are? Glad you asked…

Current downward trend is presented as follow: Green à red. Red. Red. à green -> red. Red à green à red red red à green à red? Trend break? We will find out tomorrow for sure. 

Today is considered an inside candle day which some actually consider like a doji. What this means is after a big day of movement to a major support (200 ema) followed by an inside candle (a candle fully within the previous days range) this candle can be considered as indecision and can indicate support established and a reversal of trend. So that will be interesting to watch. Some experts also equate it to a continuation of trend too. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r4r36bf6ydt81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5c2867e858bfbc42f24e0faeee5e1fc644b8cc9

If you don’t believe in what you are trading and you don’t believe in the move that’s about to happen you will never trust your position long enough to see profits or will trust it too long and end up losing profits. I felt more comfortable and more calculated holding 2/3 of my buy power till the end of the day then I did with trading just to trade. 

Discipline in trading is 100% crucial.",40.0,u346o0,2022-04-14T00:03:44Z,2022-04-14

10470,appl,stocks,POST,Facebook parent Meta set to take nearly 50% cut from virtual sales — and Apple is calling it out,"Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.’s intent to take a nearly 50% cut of digital asset sales within its emerging metaverse is drawing widespread criticism from developers and longtime nemesis Apple Inc. Meta FB, +0.40% said in a blog post Monday it is allowing a handful of Horizon Worlds creators to sell virtual assets that could eventually include NFTs. Virtual-reality platform Horizon Worlds is considered an integral piece of Meta’s unfolding metaverse. The company said it will take up to 47.5% on each transaction, which includes a “hardware platform fee” of 30% via its Meta Quest Store, as well as a 17.5% cut on Horizon Worlds.

“We think it’s a pretty competitive rate in the market. We believe in the other platforms being able to have their share,” Vivek Sharma, Meta’s vice president of Horizon, told The Verge. But Meta’s plan immediately drew blowback from developers — who pointed out NFT marketplace OpenSea takes a 2.5% cut of each transaction while LooksRare charges 2% — and some pointed comments from antagonist Apple AAPL, +1.63%.

“Meta has repeatedly taken aim at Apple for charging developers a 30% commission for in-app purchases in the App Store — and have used small businesses and creators as a scapegoat at every turn,” Apple spokesman Fred Sainz said in an email to MarketWatch. “Now — Meta seeks to charge those same creators significantly more than any other platform. \[Meta’s\] announcement lays bare Meta’s hypocrisy. It goes to show that while they seek to use Apple’s platform for free, they happily take from the creators and small businesses that use their own.”

Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has blasted Apple for charging developers 30% for in-app purchases on the App Store. “As we build for the metaverse, we’re focused on unlocking opportunities for creators to make money from their work,” he said in November. “The 30% fees that Apple takes on transactions make it harder to do that, so we’re updating our subscriptions product so now creators can earn more.”

Underscoring the reaction of developers, Blockparty CEO Vladislav Ginzburg told MarketWatch: “Facebook keeps all media uploaded to it, retains all user data and owns every step of the process to sell to marketers. Rather than enable creators to share in the value they bring to Facebook, their goal is to take half of the sale. No thanks.”

I’m pretty sure  it’ll fail and a year later Apple will come up with their version and make a killing.

Meta has so many viable business models and ways around apples privacy issue. 
They could develop a decent YouTube competitor with their Facebook watch. A stand-alone versión where youtubers can make extra money and content.
Yet it’s kept somewhere inside Facebook along so many random services. Just like yahoo. 
They could have a Shopify like service that can tag along with affiliate links and server space.
And that way see more data outside their Facebook app. Because that’s how google is still making money from ads.
They tag multiple services and know where to get customers from all their services combined. 



So That’s my prediction. 
Facebook turning into yahoo.
