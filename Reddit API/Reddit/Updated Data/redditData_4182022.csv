GameStop's share price is **completely void of the company's performance.**

There is no mathematical financial model for measuring (let alone forecasting) this motive fueling GME's price-movement. I can't think of a stock to-date that has ever been valued this way.  Meaning, value found in the stock pertains to new information about it's speculated SI let alone it's SI borrow rate.

Remember all those important ratios that tell us about a companies performance? *Useless*. Even better are option prices--which for most days, are *hysterical*. The average cost for call options usually equal the cost for puts with rarely ever a one-sided sentiment because too many people are assigning value to it's SI rather than the company's performance. BIG PICTURE, nobody knows where the hell this thing will go each day. If people by the dozens are buying this stock based on speculation around information not just separate from GameStop's performance, but a whole other company's activities, doesn't this make CAPM and other models around return obsolete? *I mean, this is speculation on a massive scale.*  Speculation around private information that is no less private than it has been since day one.

To narrow this, EMH doesn't account for **any other alternative motive besides the company's performance** and or actions tied the federal reserve.  *This is how the market SHOULD work. This is the market structure assumed to be in place not just for EMH, but for most investors/traders.* Price instead is valued around SI populated daily from [iborrow.com](https://iborrow.com) where, once the price drops to a certain point and borrow rates go up, institutions + retail will unload the buying turning returns (eventually) into a cyclical time trend.

This isn't to say EMH doesn't account for short-selling (ss) or that ss is bad, but instead, *how out of control abusive naked short selling can get which for GME, if true,* ***is VERY bad***.  We'll find out come June 2022 once dividends are official. If it's true, a cancerous bubble might pop bringing the whole market down with it. Mass-wide margin calls will be made to keep banks up afloat which will end in liquidation equal too (maybe greater) than 2008. This would literally justify why wall street was having a melt-down from what spawned in this sub. A years worth of shorting the stock plus more all because Citadel refused to take the L that came from Melvin's doings by shorting the stock a 140%. That and nobody is buying the reported SI from FINRA.  Not when $50k for ""egregious behavior"" are assigned for misreporting data. It's like the equivalent of stepping on Legos for punishment of destroying the economy.

The markets crashing in the event this bubble pops will likely be the ***least of anyone's concerns anyways.*** This is because *not a damn soul* will be dumb enough to give wall street their hard-earned money again. Not when market makers have the leverage they do to bring down the economy and everyone else's money over fucking GAMESTOP! Markets will become vastly illiquid simply because regulation doesn't regulation shit and putting your money into the markets is now a suckers game--just like playing slots. Everyone from the SEC, CFTC, market-makers and even institutions not involved will all lose the needed trust of the American people which as of now, is equivalent to nicking a main artery. Not a single American will accept ""more regulation"" as an answer for soundly regulating the markets. If the government cares to have a functioning market, functioning economy, you'll need the trust of the middle-class which likely means one thing: Prison for everyone complicit or nothing.

Anyways, this is my ted talk, I appreciate ya if you took the time to read this. I will be presenting this (plus more) next week in front of 2,000+ people downtown Chicago 10 minutes away from Citadel.

(gonna be kinda awkward)",1506.0,u6pp8i,2022-04-18T22:43:24Z,2022-04-18

How can one have an efficient market when 90-95% of all retail trades (and the VAST MAJORITY) of institutional trades, are routed through dark pools which contribute nothing to price discovery?

Efficient for who, the people who control dark pools and profit the most for having no price discovery?  Absolutely.",532.0,u6pp8i,2022-04-18T23:41:44Z,2022-04-18

Finished setting up an IBKR account and was gonna get some GME, however I read that you should DSR your shares to help encourage the short-squeeeeze. [DSRGME.org](https://DSRGME.org) doesn't have instructions for transferring from IBKR so thought buying directly from computershare might be better but I have to jump through some hoops. (setting up [wise.com](https://wise.com) for US bank account, or use Giveashare)

If i were to go the [wise.com](https://wise.com) route, do they charge a lot for the currency conversion from CAD to USD? And is the ComputerShare "" $5 fee per individual investment, and $2.50 for recurring "" per stock or per transaction?(assuming first time is $5 and subsequent purchases of the same stock are $2.50 each?)

If I were to go the GiveaShare route: ""The cost is an extra $50-100 on top of the share price"", Is that per stock or per transaction?  

I plan on doing a lump sum off the bat (Only a few grand as I wasn't as fiscally responsible in my younger years), and then adding some every paycheque/month. Just wondering if any other Canadians have any tips, guidance, or if this is even worth it. Thanks for reading :)",36.0,u635ki,2022-04-18T03:01:33Z,2022-04-18

My personal experience was I had to DRS at least one share to create an account on Computershare, but that was before I found out I could have made a US account through wise. I believe you can bypass the broker if you just buy straight from Computershare using a US bank account. You'll have to fill out some tax forms that you should be prompted by Computershare to complete.

The fees for one time and recurring investments are charged per transaction, not per share.",2.0,u635ki,2022-04-18T10:06:11Z,2022-04-18

You have to make that decision.

My smoothness limits my capacity, but I’ve seen people saying they will HODL part of their shares forever for many reasons. One of the most compelling is the fact that this is a good company and they want to demonstrate continued support. I agree with them.

That being said, however, come MOASS and, if projections are right, prices soar to the $1M+, wouldn’t it be a better approach to close the entire position along multiple exit points (I suppose the MOASS as an event may span through several weeks) and then, armed with a significant wallet, re-buy a large position after the price settles down in its rightful place (probably along the $10-30k range per share)?

There must be some flaw in my reasoning, but I’d really like to know the benefits of HODLING indefinitely compared to the smooth-brain strategy I just outlined.

The idea as another commenter mentioned is to make sure X and XX holders are able to get theirs before allowing SHF to fully cover.

The thing to remember is not selling on the way up, but on the way down.  Everyone is different and in a different situation in life, so if some people want to watch the price go from $2,214,045 back down to $7,034 and just ""HODL"" to prove a point, that's great for them.  I personally would like to retire from my shitty job, and selling at $7k per share won't let me do that, so you'll see me selling on the way back down at a 7-digit number so I can experience that generational, life changing, world helping wealth so many have been talking about.  Call me paperhands if you want lol, but I'm not going to watch millions turn into a couple hundred thousand and then be like ""DIAMOND HANDS!"" and feel good about it...

At the end of the day, everyone will play it differently.  You'll have people saying ""don't sell on the way up"" but then can't help themselves.  You'll have some people selling off 1 share at a time.  You'll have some people offloading XX shares at a certain price point.  You'll have some people with 1-2 shares that are holding like true diamond hands past 6-figures...you need to figure out what is best for you, ahead of time, and then stick to it.  The numbers are going to get ridiculous, and calculator will become your new most addicting video game ever...keep the calculator away and stick to your original plan, and then you can stay zen throughout the process.

5186,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,What are the reasons people should keep any of their GME during MOASS?,"I have not read the infinity pool DD, but I do ascribe to that concept.  The main DD discusses counterfeit shares that are indistinguishable from real shares.   When the DRS effort completes and we inevitably (tomorrow or 3 years from now) lock the float (maybe after some whale comes in and drives a final deathblow with a large DRS), that will confirm the bulk of ""stock"" held in Fidelity, TDA, etc are not real shares.

I believe at that point there will be no ""fiscally responsible"" choice for institutions to honor those IOUs and I believe all positions will be closed at cost basis or maybe at a 20% premium.  I'm not sure how this scenario effects the overall share price in the short term.  I've tried to understand the Barclay's VXX debacle and I believe that is how that situation is being approached, but boy do I have a hard time understanding it.   

Sure, this will be devastating for those not DRS'd, but I also believe that will force shorts to close ONLY through DRS share purchases, as brokers will no longer be able to sell the proven counterfeit shares.   If they truly are 200% or more short, then I don't see how it is possible for them to close.  As they buy 1 DRS share, they now own that share and can no longer buy it.  We could all paperhand, and they would still own only 75 million-ish shares, needing to close 125 million+ still.  

In reality though, many apes and insiders will not sell their DRS'd shares, making it impossible for SHF's to buy more than say 45-50 million.  

I don't see a way out.  Maybe through a presidential executive order or act of congress, but even then, it would have to be a negotiated deal with the board (of our NYSE listed company that can't be just forcibly bankrupted by the federal government out of convenience...we think), who has our backs.   

If enough paperhand, will SHF then have a controlling stake in the company, which they then force into insovlency or negotiate a bad deal?   No idea how that one plays out, but my guess is there would be a poison pill before that scenario came to pass.  

I'm very smooth and know little about the market, so all of this is my own rumination of the proverbial question, ""how does this all end?""   I just can't figure out how it ends and I'm excited we seem to be closer.  

Anyway, I have a lot of shares in IRAs that I can't DRS and I can't afford the tax it.   We'll see what happens to those, but I feel that if Fidelity does hose us on those, my DRS'd shares will be invaluable at that point and that helps me sleep quite soundly at night.",3.0,u6oh9e,2022-04-18T23:07:44Z,2022-04-18

**********

people have @#$@#$ lost their mind if they think GME post MOASS long term prices are going to come anywhere close to MOASS prices

MOASS prices -> Millions a share (best case estimate)

post MOASS long term price of GME -> in thousands of dollars a share (best case scenario)

So, what you have written i.e. sell when price is in millions during MOASS

buy back in thousands after MOASS

is the BEST strategy and is indisputable. You can argue at what point during MOASS to sell. However, there is no logical argument to not sell during MOASS or right at end of MOASS

Long term GME might be just in $1,000 to $3,000 a share range

So selling during MOASS is best strategy

****************

also GME rightful place is NOT $10,000 to $30,000 range

Even if they get marketplace right, the stock price is going to spend many years in $500 to $3,000 range before it eventually goes higher

so you are going to be able to buy in after MOASS at $500 to $3,000 range, for sure",-3.0,u6oh9e,2022-04-18T21:56:00Z,2022-04-18

5204,gme,Superstonk,POST,"Debunking ""Something pretty important from GME’s 10-K that I haven’t seen discussed here at all""","In his post u/catsinbranches (here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u62um8/something_pretty_important_from_gmes_10k_that_i/) makes a few assertions which seem to be incorrect or at least a reach.

#1

If you look at the cover page of GME's 10-K you will see the following info.

>The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. (For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)

Using this info, you can infer a Jan 2022 float of 12,000/161.12 or 74.5M shares.

This is in contrast to the analyst-reported float of 65.2M for July 31, 2021.

The difference is a remarkable 9.3M shares.

OP asserts that this difference is GME somehow showing us a more realistic short-interest number. (Which is weird because he carefully explains how short shares are not reported well and their rights are not responsibility of the company.)

However, this difference is remarkable not for it's size but rather for the fact that Ryan Cohen Enterprises, LLC, being neither a director nor officer of GME, held 9.0M shares at the time. (Read the above again after ""for the purposes of this calculation...."")

This resolves almost the entire difference and the remainder is immaterial.

#2

You will notice OP uses the July 21, 2021 float number. This is to match the stock price date. However, the stock price date is used as the year's midpoint. The shares may be as of the end of the period (Jan 29, 2022) or a weighted average. Not sure. Any apes know for certain?

Without citing the Jan 29, 2022 float we have no idea what the actual difference is.

#3

But to dig into the difference further, it is important to note the the numbers on the cover page of the 10-K include unvested shares, while the numbers on the financial statements themselves do not.

from the 10-K

> Shares of restricted stock ... are included in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding disclosed on the cover page.... In accordance with accounting guidance, the financial statement presentation excludes unvested shares of restricted Class A Common Stock.

So the analysts may have also removed the 1.3M unvested shares as of Jan 29, 2022 in addition to RC Entprises 9.0M. This would need the Jan 29, 2022 float to figure this out.

#4

Working from 3 above, we will see a problem with the analysis OP did for several other companies. He is showing a systematic difference between shares on cover pages and reported float. Well yeah, cover pages probably all include unvested shares.

Or maybe some other subtle change in calculation. *The entire point of the cover page calc is to show the biggest possible value for the company.*

#5

OP makes the additional claim that the data feeds are suspect because of an **unexplained** 5M share increase in the float between ""July 20 2021 and August 16 2021"". From GME's own financial statements we can see that shares issued and outstanding are

    69.3M on May 1, 2021 and
    75.9M on July 31, 2021

So if the data feed is using the *latest official numbers* then there will be a 6.6M share increase between those dates. If the analyst data includes vested shares, the increase is from 71.9M to 76.5M...or 4.6M shares.",148.0,u6ll9t,2022-04-18T19:41:09Z,2022-04-18

5297,gme,Superstonk,POST,The new FUD angle is that GME is a bad play because it’s a ‘socially promoted stock’. Community loyalty and involvement is one of GME’s greatest strengths but they’re spinning it to the masses as a weakness.,"It’s more media FUD in the vein of ‘appear strong when you’re weak, weak when you’re strong’. Except in this case they’re trying to make outsiders perceive one of GME’s greatest strengths as a weakness.

How on earth could it be a bad thing to have a huge dedicated core group of investors who will never stop buying shares, never stop buying products from the company, and never stop supporting that company in various other ways like diamond handing shares, positive word of mouth, aligning with Cohen’s vision in voting initiatives, generating ideas for avenues of growth, and so much more.

Grassroots, word of mouth advertising is the gold standard. Every company hopes they can take their brand to a place where their loyal customers do the advertising for them. Not only is it free, it’s also more powerful. Any good advertiser will tell you that when people hear about a product or service from friends or family members it’s worth a lot more than hearing about it from traditional advertising sources.

One of the big reasons GME is becoming a powerhouse is because of us, the shareholders. We’re holding it down and giving management the time and space to enact the turnaround.

Any publicly traded company in the world would be over the moon at having the investor base GME has. The shills say we have a short attention span and will lose interest. Well, most of us have been in this play for over 16 months and are more passionate about GME now than we were when we began.

When doing fundamental analysis on GME it would be idiotic to keep the loyal, diamond handed, ever growing investor base out of the equation. 

Not only are the shills discounting it, they actually have the balls to spin it as a knock against GameStop. 🤣",1127.0,u6kaj9,2022-04-18T18:43:49Z,2022-04-18

Fundamentals matter here, so setting aside considerations of MOASS and stock manipulation of price, is the company going to exist in the long run, is going to grow in the long run, is it investing in innovative routes to bring in sales and services, is the company using quality personnel, is it delivering on high quality standards to its customers, and is it going to be relevant and will its products and services going to remain relevant?   On that alone, it’s a solid play.  The MOASS, the RC activism, the populist sentiments, that’s all icing on the cake.   Because that keeps GME very relevant and no one can ignore it.

5386,gme,Superstonk,POST,Theory on why they keep shorting GME...,"So, imagine you are Ken Griffin or Steve Cohen, or any of the other big players that have overloaded their portfolios with naked shorts on GME.  They doubled down during the Sneeze, betting that retail investors would succumb to the time-tested psychological intimidation tactics employed by SHFs to make the little guys sell their positions.  When they realized that retail investors were holding strong because we are no longer ignorant of the scripted game, and are no longer intimidated by MSM analysts or financial ""journalists"" reporting negatively about the company, the hedgies were forced to reevaluate their approach.

SHFs know that there is zero chance of GameStop going bankrupt, now.  That reality occurred while SHFs extended their naked shorts positions into the stratosphere trying to shake loose retail investors.  Now, GameStop insiders have substantially added to their positions and GME is beginning to attract large, publicly known names into the long pool.  We are very close to MOASS and the game is about to be over.

Since the SHFs see where this is heading, haven't you wondered why they aren't jumping on the winning side of this trade?  I suspect it's because they have so many FTDs that going long would simply be used to clear shares they already owe.  The solution for them would be to unload their short positions onto some poor fool who is unaware of the shit storm brewing on the horizon.  

The only way they could do this is to convince some naive, albeit very rich, investors that GME has a bad future outlook and is surely going to fail (articles in Marketwatch, Motley Fool, Benzinga, etc. & CNBC interviews/Jim Cramer, etc.).  To support what a terrible company GameStop is, just look at how the price is plummeting.  This all seems like a perfect setup to convince other people that they will make tons of money by shorting GME.  How convenient that those new positions could relieve the SHFs of their one way ticket to the poor house.  

After that crap is unloaded on the same sort of rubes that invested (and lost) fortunes with Bernie Madoff, then SHFs could go long GME and capitalize on the inevitable MOASS.

I have absolutely no proof that any of this is happening.  I just don't find it unlikely.",62.0,u6ipfh,2022-04-18T17:35:39Z,2022-04-18

5441,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Trading just changed for GME - Im excited for this week but excited for this afternoon also... Just some observations...,"This was not shorting at all man. Look at the options chain. All the weekly options fro. Last week are gone and the majority of out the money prices that were hedged for disappeared. This allowed market makers to offload the hedged shares without risk. It's called delta hedging and right now there is no need for anything above $150 so we naturally fell back to the levels they need to hedge for, the 125-140 channel.

Unless there's some sort of large purchasing or announcement that bring in massive amounts of options buying above the 140 150 range we will see this drop the way that it did. 


TLDR - The price rose due to hedging and options chain because of fomo from RC buying and dividend announcement.  And with the fomo options from that expiring in last weeks monthly option chain, market makers can offload any unnecessary shares.",103.0,u6htr4,2022-04-18T17:40:23Z,2022-04-18

5470,gme,Superstonk,POST,"Huh, ya don't say? A cellar stock returns GME on a ""Similar to"" list.","Was doing some data collection for a fun little project, came across this PUPS ticker with only one stock generated in the ""Similar to"" list. Clearly, this company is entirely unrelated to GME. Also worth noting that there is a ""People also watch"" list above this one and it didn't make it into the screen grab. So I don't think GME's appearance has anything to do with similar engagements or anything like that. Any theories? Would love a shill's opinion mostly, bring it.

5504,gme,Superstonk,POST,anyone look into OG meme NAKD 'reverse' split and how it may correlate to GME upcoming regular split?,"Haven't seen anyone mention or look into this yet so thought I would bring it up as it may now be relevant with GME's upcoming stock split dividend.


Another stock that was in the short basket was naked brand NAKD, now under ticker CENN as of Jan 13,2022. I watch all the OG meme basket stocks just for fun. What's interesting with naked brand in particular is that they underwent a 'reverse' split on Dec 22,2021. This was a 15:1 reverse split. Please note that this is a 'REVERSE' split, this is the opposite of a stock split and the opposite of what GME will be doing. In a reverse split you had 15 shares now you only have 1.


Take a look at the chart.  Price absolutely plummets after the REVERSE split. $6.25 to $2.00 in a month. Please note again this was the opposite type of split GME is doing.


Why I'm interested in this is that it may help show that a 'REVERSE' split is very damaging in a heavily shorted basket stock. If we correlate the opposite, then a regular stock split in a heavily shorted basket stock should be very beneficial.


TLDR; NAKD gives us a good example of how a 'REVERSE' split with a meme basket stock plays out. NAKD got destroyed after the 'REVERSE' split. GME is doing the opposite and giving a regular split in the form of a share dividend so should see some big gains after the split if they correlate to each other.",8.0,u6euqd,2022-04-18T14:46:16Z,2022-04-18

Congrats OP!! Way to goooo!! 🥳🍾🎉Send them all! DRS 100%

3 KEYS TO LOCKING FLOAT:

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠The word about DRS and GME fundamentals needs to be spread to the masses outside of Reddit. Send everyone to drsgme.org

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Apes with money tied up in other investments could convert those to GME and DRS.

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Apes with shares in brokers that will not DRS, such as Etoro and T212 : think about selling and re-buying elsewhere!! They don’t have shares anyway, so selling hurts nothing. Don’t trust your millions to a broker that won’t transfer. Just read their TOS! https://www.drsgme.org/drs/direct-register-shares-from-etoro

I will repost this later tonight and see if we have better luck.

**\*Obligatory,** none of this information is financial advice and is the result of my studies. All investors must do their own due diligence, come to their own conclusions, and make their own financial decisions.

**Update to Original Post:**

* Added onto the TL;DR
* I've added onto and clarified AIG's 2008 securities lending losses within this post to include information that funds, and borrower loses could be substantial worse for GME securities lending counterparties, and
* included new funds

**If you've read the prior posts and are just here for the updated funds, please proceed to Ralph Wiggum**. Otherwise, here you go.

**TL;DR** Broker Dealers (primarily believed to be the big banks/prime brokers) are estimated to have borrowed at least **5.72M shares of GME** from mutual funds and ETFs (funds). The funds are exposed to potentially catastrophic securities lending counterparty loses. The brokers are also exposed to risks in multiple areas. They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

It's a long post and I believe it is 100% worth the read as it shows the interconnectedness of the entities involved and how everyone, from the short seller all the way back to the shareholders of the funds loaning the GME shares are exposed to potentially catastrophic losses during MOASS, which is why I believe my shares are safest at Computershare.

# Background Information

**Broker dealers are exposed to potentially high $ securities lending counterparty risks from GME and we can see it.** Mutual funds and ETFs (funds) have lent GME shares to broker dealers who in turn lent it out to be shorted. The lending of this security makes the fund and the broker dealer a ""counterparty"", hence ""securities lending counterparty"".

[AIG](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-aig) suffered roughly $21B in losses from this same business practice in 2008. They would borrow securities from a broker (Citadel & others) and lend them to hedge funds, who would short sell the stock. AIG's counterparties (the brokers) were bailed out [$43.7B](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytint/docs/aig-bailout-disclosed-counterparties/original.pdf) in 2008.

There are **two main types of securities lending risks**.

**The first risk** type is what AIG experienced as the collateral they received from the lent securities was reinvested in illiquid high-risk assets, including assets backed by subprime residential mortgage loans which lost value during the sell-offs.

In 2014, current SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce had the following to say; *Through the securities lending program, AIG and its life insurance subsidiaries had massive exposure to residential mortgage-backed securities. At the height of the 2008 crisis, the program experienced a run, and AIG could not meet the massive repayment demands.* ***The losses in the securities lending program were severe enough to imperil a number of AIG’s regulated life insurance subsidiaries. Before the bailout, AIG itself may have been insolvent.*** [\[Source\]](https://www.mercatus.org/publications/financial-markets/securities-lending-and-untold-story-collapse-aig)

In order to close a securities lending transaction, the fund needs to return the collateral to the borrower when the borrower returns the share, which would mean the fund would need to close some of its positions unless it has the collateral already set aside, which it most likely does not because **everybody wants more money**. Since AIG reinvested the collateral they received in dog shit wrapped cat shit, the collateral had lost a lot of value and wasn't worth as much when they needed to cash out.

If you want to get really technical on 2008 securities lending issues, check out [Securities Lending & Why Wall Street Sold 2.5T Treasury IOU's Last October](http://www.24hgold.com/english/news-gold-silver-securities-lending-and-why-wall-street-sold-2-5-trillion-treasury-ious-last-october.aspx?contributor=Eric+de+Carbonnel&article=2507793268G10020&redirect=False)

**The second risk** **type** ***relates to a worst-case scenario*** *-- when a borrower, such as a hedge fund or investment bank, collapses and is unable or unwilling to return assets to the fund. Let's use Fannie Mae (2008) bonds as an example. A fund accepts Fannie Mae bonds as collateral, and while holding that paper, its value decreases. The agreement calls for these securities to be marked to market daily, with any decrease in value covered by the borrower. However, if the borrower fails to increase the amount of the collateral, and does not return the borrowed securities when they are due, the fund now has collateral worth less than the value of the securities lent out, and it experiences a loss in its net asset value.* [\[Thanks Motley Fool\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2008/10/16/the-risky-business-of-securities-lending.aspx)

Thinking of that AIG example, funds are currently lending GME shares to brokers who are ***relending*** the security to a hedge fund to be short sold...

During MOASS, the [mutual funds,](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/) and [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks) currently loaning GME, and the *investors* of those funds, have a similar but worse exposure to securities lending risks then the brokers who were involved in AIG's scheme.

The brokers currently borrowing and lending GME have a similar but worse [exposure](https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/securities-lending-a-focus-on-two-risk-areas-1495080131) than what AIG's exposure was in 2008, which was famously catastrophic for AIG and its counterparties... I wonder how it will go for the current GME lenders?

What's more, the *investors* of the funds loaning the shares are the very brokers who are borrowing shares from the funds. **They own shares of the ETFs** **loaning the GME shares** (ex. BofA owns 11.6M shares worth $3.3B, of IJH) So, they're exposed as lenders of the securities and as investors in the funds loaning the shares.

And MOAR, some **funds also hold a lot of the brokers OWN shares** (ex. VTI holds 83M shares of JPM - worth $13B)... So, the broker is now exposed to counterparty risk 3 ways...

&#x200B;

1. They are borrowing and relending the security,
2. They own shares of the fund which exposes them as *investors* in the fund, AND
3. Many of these funds hold shares of the broker. If the fund needs to liquidate any of these holdings due to their own counterparty loses, the share values will lose money as they're being sold off.

Here are the main stats from the NPORT [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/tpm5si/nport_gme_deep_dive_so_much_gme_lending_total/) I made which showed how much GME was being lent:

&#x200B;

* **138** of **213** funds were loaning GME shares
* **70** funds lent out more than **90% of their GME shares**
* An estimated **5.72M of total 11.98M GME shares were on loan** (this is just loaned securities and does not account for rehypothecated shares or other avenues of securities lending),
* from the data filing, we were able to see the fund's securities borrowers and how many $ worth of securities they borrowed (this includes all securities, not just GME). We KNOW that someone(s) on      the list of borrowers is borrowing GME.
* The primary borrowers of the one fund reviewed (a Fidelity Mutual Fund which had lent $61M worth of GME) were; Morgan Stanley **($911M)**, Goldman Sachs **($454M)**, Citi **($388M)**, BofA **($380M)**, JPMorgan **($321M)**, State Street **($239M)**, Barclays **($115M)**, BNP Paribas **($105M)**, UBS **($56M),** etc.
   * That's a lot of $ on loan for just one fund...
* A lot of funds loaning the GME shares are managed by the same list of entities who are borrowing shares from the funds

I'll leave some quotes regarding securities lending counterparty risks later in this post for additional clarity.

# The Web

**Example 1** of securities lending counterparty risk is the fund which is estimated to have lent out the most GME shares:

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTI)** filed on 3/1/22 for holdings on 12/31/21.

Total GME Shares = 1,847,760

Total GME Shares on Loan ≈ 1,185,700

See the prior post for supporting information on how this was calculated. This fund has a lot of exposure when short sellers fail to return all of their shares during MOASS after the short sellers have been liquidated.

The NPORT-P filing also gives us a list of the fund's securities borrowers along with the value of the securities on loan. This is for all securities, not just GME. Here are this fund's borrowers:

*Processing img wtyi16w43et81...*

Take a close look at those names... These entities are borrowing the funds then lending them out to hedge funds, best case scenario. We don't know for sure which entity is borrowing GME specifically, but someone(s) here is.

I wonder who is investing in this fund if they have counterparty risk as well? As of their last filing, these guys:

*Processing img 1a2zzo083et81...*

Nearly $10B worth of this fund's shares are held by the same entities listed as the securities borrowers of the fund.

So wait, the same entities who are borrowing securities from the fund, also own shares of the fund? They have counterparty exposure as fund ***investors*** as well as the ***borrower/lending agent***. $ bills are starting to add up a bit.

# But Wait... There's MOAR!

The fund has exposure as well. When short sellers fail to return shares during MOASS, the fund may need to liquidate holdings to keep its head above water. Here are some of the funds holdings:

*Processing img lkwunc4e3et81...*

Okay, so when short sellers fail to return shares to the lending agent (the banks), and

the banks fail to return the shares to the fund, and

the banks own shares of the ETF, and

the ETF owns shares of the banks... What happens?

# Computershare

Direct Registration is how I am protecting my shares in the event my broker defaults and is liquidated [(741)](https://usbankruptcycode.org/chapter-7-liquidation/subchapter-iii-stockbroker-liquidation/section-741-definitions-for-this-subchapter/) from short selling OR securities lending counterparty losses. There's lots of DRS posts out there that will break down the reasons why I feel GME's transfer agent, Computershare, is the best place for my shares.

I'm not telling you that your broker will default. I'm also not telling you to DRS your shares. I'm simply saying that **I feel safest knowing most of my shares are on GME's books at Computershare** because when marge calls and the short sellers are liquidated, that exposure is going to be passed elsewhere, including to the funds and other entities involved in the securities lending listed above, and the other avenues we've done our DD on.

# The Counterparty Risk

[Deloitte - Securities Lending](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/financial-services/articles/addressing-securities-lending-risks-with-blockchain.html)

***A typical securities lending transaction involves multiple entities: borrower, lender, lending agent, prime broker, and clearinghouse.*** *Lenders typically include various investment firms, as noted above, whereas, broker-dealers and hedge funds make up the bulk of the borrower group. Lending agents, on the other hand, are broker-dealers, custodial banks, and some large asset management firms as well.*

***In almost every securities lending transaction, lenders are exposed to multiple risks***, such as counterparty default risk, collateral reinvestment risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, and legal risk. In particular, counterparty default risk and collateral reinvestment risk seem to have captured the most attention from regulators.

[SEC - Securities Lending by U.S. Open-End and Closed-End Investment Companies](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/securities-lending-open-closed-end-investment-companies.htm)

*Lending agents* ***often*** **(not always)** *indemnify* (protect) *funds against the risk that the borrower will fail to return the borrowed securities (to the extent that the value of the collateral is insufficient to replace the unreturned securities).* ***Lending agents, however, typically do not indemnify funds for losses incurred in connection with cash collateral reinvestment.***

[mutualfunds.com - Securities Lending](https://mutualfunds.com/education/mutual-funds-and-security-lending/)

***When a fund lends the stocks,*** *these assets are not actually part of the fund, the put-up collateral is.* ***Typically, U.S. Treasuries or cash is used.*** *However,* ***in*** ***recent years everything from mortgage backed securities and derivatives to letters of credit and other exotic I.O.U.’s have become commonplace***\*. These sorts of instruments fluctuate in price and must be marked-to-market daily. That can actually affect the net asset value of the mutual fund if they swing rapidly. An additional risk is if the mutual fund invests that money in something less than desirable to juice returns.\*

*Secondly, if the collateral drops in value by too much, the investor borrowing the shares may be forced to add additional collateral or cover the short early. If they can’t,* ***the mutual fund and its investors are on the hook for the damage.***

The same thought process for [ETFs](https://www.etf.com/etf-education-center/etf-basics/understanding-securities-lending?nopaging=1#:~:text=ETF.com%20Securities%20lending%20is%20a%20fairly%20simple%20process,typically%20hold%20thousands%20of%20shares%20of%20various%20stocks).

**\[Insert dumpster fire meme\]**

Do you see the vastness of risks involved in the short selling process, especially if most of that short selling is naked short positions AND other hidden means?

Decentralized tokenized exchanges could potentially benefit from the fallout illegal naked short selling will cause the world's financial system 🤔

# fin

When short sellers are liquidated during MOASS, funds, fund shareholders, and fund borrowers are exposed to huge securities lending counterparty risks. The above information shows a small glimpse of the GME securities lending taking place and the potential exposures for everyone involved.

Again, these statistics do not include any information on rehypothecated shares, any other avenues of securities lending, or any form of short interest. This is merely the estimated number of shares on loan by some funds.

Every quarter of 2021, the NSCC has had this (or similar verbiage) to say regarding the Clearing Funds backtesting, *the largest deficiency incurred during the quarter was mainly driven by a concentrated security* ***exhibiting idiosyncratic risk*** AND they didn't have enough cash on hand to cover the potential default of their largest member 5 times in 2021. This had never happened before. [DTCC](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/policy-and-compliance)

*What's an exit strategy?*

**You want to get even wilder?** Go look at the main holdings and shareholders of **AGG, IGSB, & NEAR** to find out that **these entities are indirectly holding in their own and each other's debt through ETFs.**

**Note 3:** If everything is starting to look like a web, maybe there is a hub? I feel it important to point out that A LOT of entities listed as borrowers or shareholders of the funds above, are also listed on the **W\^E\^F PARTNERS** [**PAGE**](https://www.weforum.org/partners#D) **including** [**BCG**](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1512103363311243269?cxt=HHwWisC4nev_iPwpAAAA) **& the DTCC** along with a lot of other familiar faces, including [Ken Griffin](https://thefundchicago.org/who-we-are/board/kenneth-griffin/). Maybe there is a connection, maybe it is complete coincidence. When coincidences pile up though, it's worth looking into them.

**Note 4:** I am not a financial advisor and none of this information is financial advice. I am simply providing information that is publicly available.

>They are; relending the borrowed shares, they own shares of the funds that are originally lending the GME shares, and their own company's shares are within some of the funds' holdings. (Insert WTF face) I'll explain more.

The share you have at your broker is like a [matrioshka](https://c.tenor.com/jyB_HRqiiOMAAAAC/matryoshka-russian-doll.gif) (russian doll):

You may look at it and think you own the share, then you uncover the first layer and notice there is another ""owner"" inside, uncover the second layer and notice there's yet another ""owner"" of that same share, and so on and so forth. **SO MANY LAYERS, SO MANY ALLEGED OWNERS BUT ONLY ONE SHARE.**

Turns out, you don't really own that share my friend.

**The only way to remove all the layers and be the true owner of your share is by Directly Registrering that share to your name.**

5641,gme,Superstonk,POST,DD: Statistical analysis of trading data from GME shows that the outstanding shares are inflated by a factor of 10. SHORTS DID NOT COVER!,"  

Disclaimer: All data shown here is publicly available and can be downloaded and evaluated with the scripts I provide. Please read my previous posts for this. I do not claim the correctness of the data and the source code, everyone is invited to review, repeat and improve the analysis.

**GME is a highly volatile stock:**

As a measure of volatile, the one minute candles between 03/13/2022 and 04/13/2022 were evaluated. For this purpose, the standard deviation of the percentage change per minute was calculated and compared with all Russel 1000 tickers.

Std. of the percentual candle = standard deviation( (close - open)/open )

The following graph shows the results against the market cap.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sj3mus6a59u81.jpg?width=2156&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8244edb12bf05d9ab9e31a26001412bc0ae8dcd

**The volatility is driven by trading volume:**

The volatility can be driven by various factors, but if you take a look at the trading volume, it quickly becomes clear that it plays a decisive role.

As a measure of trading volume, the number of shares traded per minute is multiplied by the opening price and normalized to the market cap.

mean percentage volume dollar = mean( volume \* open ) / market cap

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/r2dojuzc59u81.jpg?width=2182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0f41953fa0555209e5c806eba52f9f8d6208169

**Can retail generate this volume?**

**Short answer: No**

Long answer: Retail would have to keep selling each other shares to generate 0.42% of the market cap per minute. To generate such a high trading volume per minute you need both the financial resources and the infrastructure. Retail would quickly run out of money just because of the transaction fees and the spread, not to mention that trading algorithms with the necessary performance and infrastructure are needed.

In addition, retail is clearly a value investor at GME, which is clear from the published DRS figures, for example. In addition, the published data from fidelity show that retail buys both dip and rip. As the following graph illustrates. Data from the wayback archive was analyzed. Each point represents a saved status since 01.01.2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gw3qthge59u81.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a276a10431cd9b224492b35a9463c7dcf2a01fff

**Conclusion: MM, HF, Banks are driving the volume and thereby the volatility. They manipulate the price.**

**How is the price manipulated?**

It is not possible for Retail to provide direct evidence of manipulation as Retail does not have access to the necessary data. The process is not transparent. Therefore, retail has to rely on indirect indicators. An indirect indicator is the correlation between occurring gaps in one minute candles and the outstanding shares. The following graph illustrates this relationship for all Russel 1000 tickers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8u4gvqtg59u81.jpg?width=2098&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1450c790675d3d102d0130c49708c75705b141e

The proportion of gaps in one minute candles is obviously much too small for the outstanding shares. Note the log scale. Here one can conclude that GME is traded as if it had approx. 10x outstanding shares. 

Put simply: If we did not know the outstanding shares and someone gave us this graph and the proportion of gaps for GME, where would we place GME?

**Challenge for Artificial Intelligence Experts:**

1. load trading data from all Russel 1000 tickers.

2. train AI on 500 randomly selected tickers (exclusive GME) to estimate the outstanding shares based on the trade data.

3. calculate the accuracy of the model on the remaining 500 tickers (excl. GME)

4. determine the outstanding shares for GME

5. repeat the procedure to test the robustness of the model

**Conclusion: MM, HF, banks create artificial liquidity by their market power in a legeal or illegal way (retail has no/little possibility to check it). The statistical analysis of GME clearly shows the deviations compared to other Russel 1000 tickers and proves that only MM, HF, banks have enough financial means and infrastructure to implement this. This manipulation is created by the artificial increase of the outstanding shares by a factor of approx. 10x. SHORTS DID NOT COVER.**",8232.0,u68nzl,2022-04-18T09:02:29Z,2022-04-18

Excellent work! It is clear that the underlying price movement is carefully orchestrated in an attempt to maintain institutional solvency; by using derivative manipulation with the ultimate intent of kicking the can.

DRS is counteracting their base driver of share dilution, and the result is ulterior tactics for share creation/dilution; be it through ETF manipulation or equity swaps.

Suffice to say, even IF they found additional methods for injecting synthetics into the market, those positions, (including the rolling deficits for activity prior to the button turning off), need to close in order for them to come out of this mess clean.

If I may have suggestion: could you do the same analysis on LRC? The daily volume on several up days was above the total supply...rings a bell?..

And yes, you can have fake cryptos like you have fake shares. When you buy a crypto on a centralized exchange, it is possible you don't own the crypto but instead you just own an IOU with the exchange based on the value of the crypto. Hence buying this crypto would not exercise any upward pressure on the price. You would only own the crypto once you move it out of the exchange into a personal wallet.

My gut feeling is that something dodgy is going on with LRC. It would be great if you could replicate your analysis. Tks fellow ape.",6.0,u68nzl,2022-04-18T15:02:12Z,2022-04-18

5726,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,DD: Statistical analysis of trading data from GME shows that the outstanding shares are inflated by a factor of 10. SHORTS DID NOT COVER!,"/u/sdfprwggv This is amazing work. A couple of things that I think you should try to take into account and address in a separate post:

1. GME has a relatively small float. I'd recommend using this method to try to *predict* the float sizes of several other stocks with small floats to see if there is any issue with predicting small floats.
2. Relating to number 1 above, it would be nice to see an %error chart corresponding to the last chart in your post (minus outliers like GME) to judge relative effectiveness. Would be cool to see what other stocks don't line up (someone below said Popcorn is also off, so that is a pretty promising result.)
3. I think you solidly show here that retail is for the most part not driving price movements and volatility. However, regardless of where that volatility comes from, isn't that volatility the root cause of the gaps, and taking into account that GME has a small float, doesn't this basically skew/make your prediction off? I guess what I am asking is if there is a way for you to check for confounding variables.

Sorry if above comes across as really critical, but it is refreshing to see work with hard data like yours. I'd like this subreddit to regain a culture of DD with hard data which we peer review and discuss together.",2.0,u68nzl,2022-04-18T19:11:51Z,2022-04-18

How do much more options activity on GME affect this relative to the others?

The stock seems to move, in times of increased volume and volatility almost exclusively due to options activity. Why not look at the times of increased volume, how options have been different?

I have the daily chart candles up on my desktop computer, but I've been working on other stuff for the past few hours and just revisited the price now. This shit has to end, and the only way it's going to end is to DRS as many shares as possible. This is what I am doing personally, and it's only my opinion and not financial advice. I already have a direct buy account at CS. I did my first DRS this morning after taking a significant tax hit by DRSing shares transferred out of a broker IRA. I'm going to start the process to do the same thing tomorrow. I know what my tax exposure will be down to the dollar. I don't care if I have to sell my old ass body, sell my old ass sperm, sell plasma, sell my old ass underwear...whatever I have to do to pay my taxes. I'm getting every single fucking IRA share out of my brokerage and into a CS account. Again, do what suits your circumstances. Don't nessarily take my advice if it is not right for you.

2.	Old CEO & CFO paid themselves about $1m/year, new board members $200k - they are not interested in bleeding the company but in growing the stock value. 
3.	GameStop are pursuing the ‘Clawback clause’ in relation to previous management. This  reclamation of stock means that RC and co *have evidence of misdeeds by the former CEO and CFO.*

5947,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"Just dropping these here, as I'd rather not make a whole thread just to share a couple of ideas. Potential NFT applications in game development:

**Backer rewards**: Early-access devs could partition X% of all future profits (let's say 5% as a ballpark figure) as a royalty split among backers above a certain tier. This serves a couple of purposes. First, it gives backers something tangible in the real world for having backed a project. Second (primarily for multiplayer games), it shifts the impact of backer rewards out of the ingame economy and into the real-world one - something that benefits both the people playing the game and the backers themselves, by removing real-world money from the game's ecosystem. As long as the game makes it, nobody loses.

**Bug/first-clear achievement bounties**: Setting aside the above use case (though something similar *could* function in this capacity as well), there's also the potential to reward users who crack troublesome bugs with unique NFTs. Let's say, for example, that there's a duping bug in a competitive multiplayer game that the devs can't seem to completely eliminate. A player manages to track down, replicate, and document the bug, and as a consequence, the developers are able to fix the problem at a mechanical level instead of just patching the exploits the mechanic is causing. 

That person's contributed significantly to the integrity of the game, and the devs *could* simply pay them a cash bounty. But why not give them a digital medal instead? Bugs can be famous (or infamous) in gaming history, and an NFT commemorating the resolution of such a bug could well appreciate in value like more conventional antiques. So instead, the devs could mint an NFT representing the bug, with the name of the player who gave them the critical report, and the date of resolution.",12.0,u66xvg,2022-04-18T07:54:14Z,2022-04-18

They are moving the prices of everything in their favor to survive another day.  

So at the beginning of the day, they needed to:
- Pump entire market to set up for today’s price drop. They can’t let the market drop quite yet. 
- Drop GME price while pumping market.
- Once stabilized the balance sheets, we can move on to the next phase. 

Once they have it balanced out:
- They can let natural market selloff’s play out. 
- But they need to drop GME’s price with the entire market. 

Any time there will be a market-wide selloff, they need to dump GME.

Any time GME has to go up and they can’t suppress the price effectively, they pump the market with it.",12.0,u66xvg,2022-04-18T16:45:48Z,2022-04-18

6210,gme,Superstonk,POST,Something pretty important from GME’s 10-K that I haven’t seen discussed here at all,"Alright, I kept waiting for someone else to post about this and it hasn’t happened yet so here I am, posting about it.

https://preview.redd.it/z94oj78a67u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd750e5684c0303297c3b18a64f0c7c4f724c3e1

There is a sentence on the first page of the 10-K that is basically a standard sentence that all 10-Ks have now, but it is so informative and a great reference for point, and also a great point of comparison to other stocks. Once you understand what it’s telling you, it’ll jack your tits. Here’s the sentence:

>The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. (For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)

Let’s break that down.

**Voting and non-voting common stock:** *adding an edit here - non-voting stock can refer to a different class of stock (such as preferred stock) that does not offer voting rights, but GME doesn't have any class of stock issued other than the common shares we all own which do offer voting rights. End of edit.* non-voting stock is stock that you’ve loaned out, so you no longer have voting rights. If you loan your shares and they are short-sold, the person who has purchased those shares now has the voting rights instead of you. Think Vanguard in the recent pre-proxy statement - they have 5M shares but don’t have voting rights. Those 5M non-voting shares would be included in the total in this statement, and because someone else now holds the voting rights in another account, they would then be included again as another 5M shares with voting rights. *Second edit here: there are a lot of comments calling this point I make about lenders holding ""non-voting"" stock incorrect because they say that non-voting stock only refers to other classes of stock that don't give voting rights, and therefore everything else I wrote must be incorrect, but I'd like to point out that the main takeaway and most important part of this post is* ***not*** *about non-voting stock but rather about the ""non-affiliate"" component of the above statement. Also, if the holders like Vanguard, who have filed 13 G statements with the SEC to show their holdings but 0 voting rights don't count as non-voting stock, what happens to them in this scenario? Are they just no longer included as holders? Or are they still included as holders but just under the ""voting stock"" category and therefore it doesn't change the rest of what's below? But as I said, that's not the important part of this post, focus on the ""non-affiliate"" part. End of second edit.*

**Non-affiliates:** anyone who isn’t an insider

**Why use July 30, 2021:** The end of the second fiscal quarter, which is what all companies use as a reference point in these statements

So basically this is saying that the value of the float shares (i.e. non-insider shares) they have on record as being owned on July 30, 2021 was $12.0B based on a closing price of $161.12. If you divide $12.0B by $161.12, you get about 74.48M shares… but… the actual size of the float on that date was about 65.17M shares. That means that 114.28% of the float was *officially* owned at that time.

Well well well… didn’t that get more interesting all of a sudden!

“No, this isn’t interesting, we already know more of the float is owned than should be, and besides, this is just another bullshit number because the actual number of shares owned is way higher than that” Ok fine, yes, I agree with all of that. That’s why this post isn’t over yet.

I’m going to use a bit of a silly analogy here but hopefully it can help illustrate where I’m going with this post so please come along on this tangent with me. If you’ve got a pretty good understanding of why counterfeit shares (AKA naked shorts) would easily exceed this number, you can skip past the weird monopoly game.

# Monopoly, but make it weird

Let’s say you’re playing monopoly, and the bank holds all the properties. You can buy properties directly from the bank until they run out of properties, at which point you can then only purchase them from other players who are willing to sell their properties.

https://preview.redd.it/0yia6a7t67u81.png?width=1176&format=png&auto=webp&s=48033f7aed95a92c962462431150ca59d836db36

Now this player, we’ll call him Mark, says “hey Tom, I need some Monopoly money, let me borrow Park Place and sell it to Suzy, but don’t worry I’ll buy it back later and return it to you. I’ll write up a contract with the bank so you know I’m good for it.” Mark is short selling monopoly properties. At this point, we could say that Park Place has two rightful owners, Tom and Suzy, but currently only Suzy gets to collect the money when someone lands on her space.

But what if someone decided to make this game of monopoly way more complicated and there are now way too many players, instead of buying directly from the bank or a player you now have to make all of your purchases through an intermediary (a broker) and you’re blind to what other players own and who you’re buying from.

[I’m actually a little surprised I found a picture for this.](https://preview.redd.it/btf2p89y67u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=f70bbdfda9075623f28910dc1700cff8913681b7)

The bank doesn’t get involved unless there are no players who can be traded with to buy or sell properties, or someone wants to write up a binding contract.

Mark, our property short seller from earlier, gets crafty and prints a whole bunch of fake copies of Park Place and starts selling them.

https://preview.redd.it/onaf6rr477u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bb7322b4a7b4a8a3f895ddefe7f107681c836a7

Mark makes a shit ton of monopoly bucks on something that cost him nothing. It’s only a problem for Mark if someone lands on the space and now all of the owners of those fake copies are expecting to get paid rent. If Mark gets the money to the intermediary (the broker) to cover the payment to each owner, then no one needs to know what he’s done. The bank doesn’t know about any Park Place owners other than Tom and Suzy, since the others all received counterfeits that the bank doesn’t know about.

# End scene.

Alright, I hope I didn’t lose you too much during that fever dream of an explanation. Basically, the monopoly properties are shares of stock, Mark is a short seller, Tom is the lender, Suzy bought the shorted share, the properties that the monopoly bank knows about (Tom and Suzy’s) are the shares included in the 10-K statement, and the players holding counterfeit properties are the people who bought naked shorted shares, AKA counterfeit shares, and they are not included in the 10-K statement.

**Important note:** this is my understanding of how the data works in these 10-K statements and I would appreciate it if anyone can help confirm or deny that the counterfeits are not included in that 10-K statement. Or confirm where the values originate from - the transfer agent? The DTCC? I couldn’t find this info.

Anyway, back to why we care about this statement. GameStop has confirmed that on July 30, 2021 there were \~74.48M float shares owned out of a possible \~65.17M float shares, or in other words, there were 9.31M shares more (officially) than there should have been.

If only we knew what the financial media, with their access to premium data that they use so they can feel smarter than everyone else, was reporting as short interest back then… oh wait, we do:

[This is for August 16, 2021.](https://preview.redd.it/w3xkwrye77u81.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=66c9d33eeb3fb8ec82f68484a78ae77444b3c6f0)

Based on his reported 10.67% SI of float, he’s using a float size of 63.17M shares. He also posted the data on July 20, 2021 which said 7.87M shares shorted (which he reports as 13.54% short interest of the float, meaning he’s working with a float of 58.12M). [Archive link for the Aug 16 tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220414020728/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1427338168412614659?s=21&t=mnlswCotXi_KAsQ-sKoOQg) and [archive link for the Jul 20 tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220414021059/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1417567467199770625?s=21&t=mnlswCotXi_KAsQ-sKoOQg). Just in case 🙃

Alright, so his definition of float size has changed by about 5M shares in just under a month. Between July 20 2021 and August 16 2021, there were 0 insider transactions. Literally zero. There were also zero SEC filings from GME to indicate any changes to the number of shares outstanding during that time. So why the fuck did his float size change by 5M shares? And I’m not even talking about the S3 SI which for some reason includes the shorted number of shares in both the numerator and the denominator of the equation. I don’t have an answer to why his float size changed so drastically, I just wanted to point out how ridiculous it is.

So based on his little chart and his tweets, the “official” number of shares shorted at the time was around 7.5M. We now know that according to GameStop’s records, at that time the number of excess shares was \~9.31M. How can you have more excess shares than shorted shares? Because mandated short selling reporting is all but useless and the number of shares shorted by financial media is bullshit, basically.

Guess that fancy S3 data isn’t so great after all… I wonder… who uses that S3 data?

[But obviously, we’re the “dumb money” 🙄](https://preview.redd.it/rv94w3wn77u81.png?width=972&format=png&auto=webp&s=788d80c3bca78e4ebf7a9509bd6df88590008339)

So if ever someone is trying to refute the GME short thesis because “Bloomberg says \_\_\_\_” or “but nasdaq says \_\_\_\_”, you can point to GameStop’s 10-K and show them that their expensive data is garbage.

“But maybe it’s GameStop’s data that’s bad.” Yes, that’s a good point, maybe it is. So let’s do a quick check of some other stocks.

TSLA’s 10-K indicates 77.25M shares owned in excess of their official float on June 30, 2021 (TSLA’s official float was \~719M)… S3 data says just over 40M shares shorted at that time, so once again it’s way under the reality. ([Archive link to July 1 2021 tweet with chart](https://web.archive.org/web/20220415184602/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1410711807984087042?s=20&t=1qNV7e2Q6DRciwZukEG14g))

The 10-K for 🍿 says 1.5M shares owned in excess of the official float on June 30, 2021, and S3 says 89.96M shares shorted (🍿’s official float was \~511M). [Archive link to July 1 tweet with chart](https://web.archive.org/web/20220415185504/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1410710310118256643?s=20&t=1qNV7e2Q6DRciwZukEG14g).

Wait… what? That 🍿 one is… backwards? Yes, it is. Now seems like a good time to explain that when a hedge fund is short selling, if there’s no one there to buy the share then market makers will just pick up the buy-side of that trade. If you think back to our monopoly game, it would be like the bank buying the property that Mark borrowed from Tom, cause it turned out Suzy didn’t want to buy it. A high number of reported shares shorted does not necessarily mean that there’s squeeze pressure if there’s just not enough buy pressure.

Interestingly, that 🍿 squeeze that ran it up to the $50+ mark started in late May and then started dropping back down in early July, right after the record date used for the non-affiliate ownership values likely made it so that the non-affiliate share ownership value increased a substantial amount right before that snapshot date that gave us a mear 0.3% excess 🍿 float shares owned. Maybe that’s a coincidence, maybe not.

[🍿 OBV rises shortly before the June 30th ownership snapshot would be taken for the 10-K. It is currently a little lower than it was on June 30th.](https://preview.redd.it/cx21othw77u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b7f720d733a4bdd1aecd648c29fb9292d53ea14)

After taking a look at the recent 10-Ks for TSLA and 🍿, I started to get curious about the historical ownership values. I also threw in a few FAANG stocks out of curiosity.

[These values are not all based on the same date because not all companies have the same fiscal quarter calendars, but this is at the end of fiscal Q2 for each stock for each of the stated years on the left.](https://preview.redd.it/rilalq8287u81.png?width=1246&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c7caa193bd73a236eff28dae23f1007f735a700)

Interestingly, TSLA, which has been undergoing a slow squeeze since late 2019, has seen a gradual increase in the excess number of shares they’ve been reporting on their 10-Ks. This is an interesting point of comparison because the non-affiliate ownership of TSLA at the end of June 2019 at 3.6% excess (in other words, 103.6% of the float was owned), and heading into just under 5% a year later, was already building enough buy pressure to ignite a slow squeeze. TSLA’s Q2 ends at the end of June, and the slow squeeze started around early December of 2019. Even if we assume that they had already reached that 5% in early December when their slow squeeze started (but I suspect it happened later based on their chart), that’s still only about ⅓ of the pressure GME had at the end of July 2021.

If the squeeze had really squoze in January 2021, why is the official excess float ownership still so high in July 2021? And just for fun, here’s a look at GME’s OBV since then to see whether that buy pressure has increased or decreased…

[GME OBV is even higher now than during the January sneeze.](https://preview.redd.it/yg9kzn4d87u81.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f4826e1da1aeeaa4d5f9f1f25d55dec3437923)

[GME OBV has also increased since that July 30th ownership snapshot from the 10-K.](https://preview.redd.it/da4qbtxi87u81.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=875f25d0f4f77a098ae2616d671d82d5492a0f56)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** hedgies are well and truly fucked. Even by “official” data before you consider all of the counterfeit shares fuckery, the retail ownership of GME is astronomical.

&#x200B;

**Method:** for anyone interested in checking out other stocks to compare to this data, I used the non-affiliate ownership statements from the 10Ks, used total outstanding share counts from either 10Qs or proxies, depending on what was a closer date to the non-affiliate statement, and insider ownership from the proxies which I then added to or subtracted from (depending on timing) all of the share volume changes in the insider transactions found on fintel. I did my best to be as accurate as possible but the dates for the various data points didn’t always line up perfectly. Happy to share my Google sheet with anyone who wants to poke around in it.

&#x200B;

**Additional point of interest:** if even the officially reported non-affiliate ownership is already above the actual float, how will that play out for a GME stock split as dividend? Do they have to bring ownership levels back down to the “correct” level? I don't have an answer here, maybe something that someone else can shed some light on.

As a comparison, TSLA announced their 5 for 1 split in the form of a stock dividend on August 11, 2020, and the actual split occurred on August 31, 2020. On June 30, 2020 there were 7.0M excess shares, at just under 5% excess of the float, and ihors3 tweeted that there were 14.76M shorted shares that day ([archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220418013247/https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1278066253207425025?s=21&t=JxJhN4FhvOpa8V_F3SdjAg)). Here’s a chart in case you’re curious as to what the price action looked like after that.

[Note that I’ve adjusted the closing price to what it would look like if there had not been a split.](https://preview.redd.it/vxxxrcdn87u81.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab05b5145d8e4f307399f54de1e80955fe28c06)

Edit: There has been a few comments mentioning that the 5M difference in float size between ihors' July 20 tweet and August 16 tweet are because of the 5M additional shares issued, and yes that's most likely the case, but GameStop released the 8K announcing those 5M shares had been sold on June 22, almost a month before the July 20 tweet, and this data is being used by some pretty big sources so you would think they would be a little more up to date. Also, even after he's finally included those 5M shares in his August 16 tweet, his float size is still off by 2M shares which is pretty significant in an already small float.",8736.0,u62um8,2022-04-18T02:45:03Z,2022-04-18

I made a dd which I will link to that backtracked current ownership (as a survey) to try to understand just how fucked they were in January2021- my most pessimistic estimates show that if everyone did sell they had the chance to cover - which means that either they couldn’t cover because my numbers were off or they didn’t want to. I calculated current pessimistic share ownership at between 68million and 84million shares with some massive assumptions that 95% of all retail sold- which is very similar to your numbers:

6287,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Something pretty important from GME’s 10-K that I haven’t seen discussed here at all,"Some big issues

1) GME may not be including Cohen's shares in their calculation of the float as his shares are held indirectly. (See below.) This would bring the the float you calculated from the 10-K cover page of 74.5M almost exactly to Aug's 65.2M.

2) Your calculation of shares out from the cover page isn't what most people (and the financial statements themselves) use as it includes nonvested shares (see statement from the 10-K below). Did into the filings to see the actual shares used for financial calculations.

**This probably explains a lot of the discrepant numbers for the various companies.**

3) Yes, from July 20 to Aug 16 the **reportable** number of shares jumped approx 5M if you are drawing your data from the financial statements. 

**source for (1)**

> The aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates of the registrant as of July 30, 2021 was approximately $12.0 billion, based upon the closing market price of $161.12 per share of Class A Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. **(For purposes of this calculation all of the registrant's directors and officers are deemed affiliates of the registrant.)**

Further data points include RC Enterprises with 9.0M shares and Sherman with 1.3M. Neither are directors nor officers of GME. If included in float calculations, the 74.5M you came up with is reduced to 64.2M. If you take out the other former execs it is very close to the 

**Source for (2)**

> Shares of restricted stock granted by us are considered to be legally issued and outstanding as of the date of grant, notwithstanding that the shares remain subject to risk of forfeiture if the vesting conditions for such shares are not met and are included in the number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding disclosed on the cover page of this annual report on Form 10-K as of March 11, 2022. In accordance with accounting guidance, the financial statement presentation excludes unvested shares of restricted Class A Common Stock, as restricted shares are treated as issued and outstanding for financial statement presentation purposes only after such shares have vested and, therefore, have ceased to be subject to a risk of forfeiture. 

**Source for (3) from the various quarterly and annual filings**

> Shares issued and outstanding 69.3M as of May 1, 2021 (the latest number available in July) and 75.9M as of July 31, 2021 (the latest number available in August). An increase of 6.6M.

> On March 31, 2022, GameStop Corp. (the “Company” or “GameStop”) announced its plan to request stockholder approval at the upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting”) for an increase in the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 through an amendment to the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Charter Amendment”) in order to implement a stock split of the Company’s Class A common stock in the form of a stock dividend and provide flexibility for future corporate needs. GameStop also intends to request stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting for a new incentive plan (the “2022 Equity Plan”) to support future compensatory equity issuances. If the 2022 Equity Plan is approved by stockholders,** it will replace the current GameStop Corp. 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock**, plus any shares subject to the 2019 Plan that expire, are forfeited, cancelled, terminated or settled in cash after the 2022 Plan is effective, will be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. GameStop’s Board of Directors has approved both stockholder proposals, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval.

I could be wrong, but it reads to me that 8 million shares of the current 76mil outstanding are still owned by GameStop themselves?  Could be part of the missing 9.31million shares you're trying to find?",1.0,u62um8,2022-04-18T20:49:42Z,2022-04-18

>Anyway, back to why we care about this statement. GameStop has confirmed  
 that on July 30, 2021 there were \~74.48M float shares owned out of a   
possible \~65.17M float shares, or in other words, there were 9.31M   
shares more (officially) than there should have been.

GameStop has 74.48m shares outstanding which means the total shares that can be owned (by insiders and the rest) are 74.48m.

Also for what feels like the millionth time: **Stop. Looking. At. The. Float.**

Back in September, Yahoo Finance got data from the S&P saying that GME float was 251.4m shares.

Should we base all our calculations on that? Should we expect to DRS 251.4m shares? Of course not.

Compare it to other tech companies, like roku, spotify, shopify, block, uber, SNAP, airbnb, just to name a few, and you will quickly realise how undervalued GME is.

All those tech companies are worth way more than GME and in most cases make less revenue AND have more net losses. 
The way we value tech companies is like that. But GME is still viewed (and valued) by many like a retailer. 

Soon people will realise GME going into NFTs, web 3.0 and Metaverse makes it a tech company... one of the most well positioned in the fastest growing industries ever (NFTs/Gaming).

The mere fact that fucking Snapchat is worth 60b$ (5x GME) should be enough to convince you of how undervalued GME is right now.",142.0,u60ipr,2022-04-18T01:24:20Z,2022-04-18

Here's a summary from the 1st page. It's only 4 pages, everyone should read it. I don't know if it's been talked about on Superstonk.

• A Bear Case ($304.00) tracking a delayed or thwarted NFT project launch alongside a plunge in the crypto sector due to potential regulation, industry average e-commerce growth with majority of sales deriving from brick-and mortar locations, and a continued market decline in physical games not offset by major business model updates.

• A Base Case ($498.00) that is similar, but with a material increase in ecommerce revenue contribution, a successful but substandard NFT marketplace plus greater impact from digital revenue sharing with vendors, and some participation in other digital-first businesses.

• A Bull Case ($1069.00) based on an evolution into the ""technology company that delights gamers"" hinted at by Ryan Cohen, with early adoption of successfully implemented blockchain technology, a significant increase in revenue attributed to e-commerce, new vendor partnerships, meaningful participation in the advertising revenue pool for gaming, and growth acceleration in the overall TAM for gaming.

With that in mind I believe if there was free price discovery we would see price \~3K$ with some clever accounting. Because the split is coming I would even remove the clever accounting. Basically valuations in Tech take the #users as the most important factor which I believe GME has the most devoted users/shareholders. 

If you think that 125K individuals from all over the world gone through the pain of DRS while see their money flying around wowww... and we did not even BLINK

&#x200B;

Some stupid math

* For me FMV is 3K \~ 225 B$ (crazy ha? maybe, I say not)
* Assuming valuation is 20x the revenue of the tech business -> 11.25B$ revenue needed
* 10K Gamestop claims that the nft market is 41B$ so you need 1/4 of that 
* You already have 125K investors which will explore / advertise / use the platform even if its early stages is crap (which it won't). With a solid base of users sky is the limit

For me this is couple of years down the road. If SHF was out of the way this is the price that I would say that my investment was a complete success story and I did not left money on the table if I would sell part of my holdings.

Basically this helps be zen in dips..

That will definitely change after the launch of the NFT Marketplace and whatever their plan with GMERICA is, whether for positive or negative.

However, as of this moment, they're a retail company with pretty much no debt, a promising board and C-Suite team, and some introspective ideas for the future of the company.

Whether they pull it off and evolve into a competitor for Amazon and other top tier companies is one we can only hope for. If they pull a Quibi then that would suck.

No matter how amazing the thought of digital resale market or cosmetic NFT market partnerships with massive brands are, if it isn't done correctly it will be done better by someone else. Let's up GameStop and RC can make it happen. If it goes well, I'd value it at $400.",-3.0,u60ipr,2022-04-18T08:12:47Z,2022-04-18

6381,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,"Is there something in the Boston water? 1st State Street's XRT, then BCG, now meet Boston Partners! Their Long/Short Fund was short GME back in Sept. 2021.","Well with all things,  it's important to look at the language as that's how technically illegal finance operations are made legal.  As we've noticed before,  but keep being told otherwise by msm, public figures,  misc others, I guess meltdowners, there is a clear difference between covering and closing/ exiting,  as referenced VERY clearly in these quotes.  

“As part of our risk management, we covered approximately half of the position on 26 January and the rest on 27 January. We also had two other short situations, which had become retail frenzy darlings and also experienced unprecedented moves due to the Reddit/Robinhood craze. We fully covered both of those positions as well. 

In addition to covering these names, we exited four more small-cap short positions and cut three additional small-cap short positions in half just in case the retail community went after them next. These short situations in aggregate cost the Sub-Fund over 6% in January.”

So. There it is. Not sure why it's still an argument in any sub. Just source the horses mouth so bear cases or just plain negative Nancy's can try to digest WHY a fund who was short would differentiate between how they managed a losing situation,  why they wouldn't just close/ exit, why would they leave them open if they sustained just a loss only to bleed more over time, and something else but I forget. 

I think this is one of the most important tid bits to note and think on vs majority of most information we've had in this sub.  This and why do brokers issue unofficial proxy numbers that don't work at gamestops official proxy,  or a web portal that issues no proxy at all. I could tell you why,  but most people don't care.",27.0,u5ywdi,2022-04-18T02:35:54Z,2022-04-18

TA, gains, and GME aside; my proudest investments have always been in companies I believed in. Even when the company was currently horseshit and I only had fond memories of them I would still invest and fight management to turn the company around. 

Fuck Leon Cooperman and his ""Invest with your wallet, not your heart"" bullshit. Invest in companies you believe in, do your DD, and fight management if that's what it takes.

Feels like a shill campaign. If you're gonna sell, then try to do it without telling anyone here. We're not going to care, because that sell pressure will make it cheaper for us to buy.

Let's say Kenny & Friends are short 1000% on GME, as well as heavily short on other stocks. Obviously when they are close to getting margin called, they have to liquidate their long positions, as well as close out other short positions.

In which order do you think we'll see the following happenings?

- A) Other stocks (their long positions) go down

- B) GME go up

- C) Other stocks (their short positions) go up

Or do you guys think it'll happen sort of simultaneously?",7.0,u5hjar,2022-04-18T03:26:34Z,2022-04-18

6889,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,| $GME Daily Discussion | New to the sub? Start here!,"Ultimately the question is: What happens after the Stock Dividend via Stock Split? Are hedgies fukd? Wen Moon?

This post was originally going to start out quite differently until I saw the post by /u/Cataclysmic98 a few days ago. I ended up revamping this a bit because Cataclysmic98 did a great job covering most of what I was attempting to do. Everyone go check out the latest post to get some background. Hopefully by now everyone has read GameStop's preliminary proxy filed on April 11th or at least gotten the gist of the good bits. 

My goal in this post is to outline some verifiable, reputable facts with GameStop's stock ownership and what will happen when the dividend is issued, sprinkled in with a bit of speculation at the end. I'll divide it into Part 1 (What We Know) and Part 2 (Speculation). I'm more than happy to edit or even delete the post if anyone debunks with more concrete info. The goal is to spread truth and shine some light on our upcoming situation. *Buckle Up* 

Let's start off with the announced stock dividend. [Typically, the issuing company (GameStop) utilizes their transfer agent (ComputerShare) to distribute the dividend. I'm sure this will be the case in our situation since GameStop has mentioned ComputerShare in their recent filings and the precedent set by Overstock utilizing ComputerShare to distribute their divided.](https://imgur.com/a/siz7jFv) The transfer agent distributes the dividend to Registered Shareholders first. The remaining dividends are then handed over to the DTC, which in turn forwards the dividends to the brokers who forward to the beneficial shareholders. In a perfect world, all beneficial shareholders will receive the dividend for each share they own before the ex-div date. But alas, if you're here reading this, you know this is a far from perfect world. 

[Per current Ortex data, there are a reported 21,270,000 shares of GameStop on loan as of April 14th.](https://imgur.com/a/CaMBKPS) Hmm... Who is entitled to the dividend if a share is loaned out? [Per the SEC, the shareholder is entitled to the dividend and the individual/company that shorted the share must pay the dividend to the lender](https://imgur.com/a/IuKmyjU)

[Per GameStop's Preliminary Proxy filed April 11th, Page 20, insiders + 5% owners hold 23,075,027 shares. RC Ventures owns 9,101,000 shares.](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/fa8db698-fa86-449b-bcd7-620e95db4d0d). [We also know from the 10-K on page F-17 filed on March 17th that 8,900,000 shares were Direct Registered with ComputerShare as of 1/29/2022.](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/71e30d98-2102-4bdd-b0b8-eb151e09f803). These numbers total just under 32 million shares, which leaves around 44 million shares as the free float. I couldn't find a definitive answer on whether or not Mutual Funds and ETFs were included in institutional ownership, so we'll just assume they are for ease. All that being said, none of us would be here today if we didn't believe this stonk wasn't naked shorted to the tits.",9.0,u5hjar,2022-04-18T02:19:15Z,2022-04-18

Anyway we've seen this shit before. Low comment karma accounts with <=1 year account age making posts that reach front page yesterday saying stuff *more illogical than the naked short selling theory:*

* ""yolo puts""
* ""twitter going to zero""
* ""Poison pill = automatic zero""
* etc etc.

, then of course market inverses these assholes. Grow some balls, inverse those holes.

# You've missed the Dip Tards, as did I. Spreads are the only decent (risk/reward) play left.

* ~~I have no positions yet. I just hate the thought of Naked Shorts.~~
* ~~Even if I miss out, helping the volatility increase and spike the price to Elon's Target, will limit covering at lower price levels.~~

Theta decay will crush you and it's just a coin flip that Elon will back away.

My advice would be to just stay away from the stock if you are bearish.

Because even if Elon doesn't decide to buy, he has to keep his offer up for a bit to remain credible.

And every Tweet he makes will continue to make bulls feel he is interested; placing additional upward momentum.

Last Thursday there were so many people short Elon on this play that the pressure will be on the shorts to keep the price down.

8557,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-18-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA"," If someone was to ask me to “describe a sideways day” I would show them todays chart. IT was the definition of sideways from open to start. One of the only days I can remember in a very a long time maybe ever when SPY made a HOD, LOD, retest HOD, retested LOD and then finishe din the dead middle of both of them… Some sideways trading for sure. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hhadur4bidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a82c723313826b61d5a8f00752c7a97ee6d30c2

You could have bought a 0dte put or 0dte call at open today and with enough patience been profitable very few days can you say that. So what did we learn from today? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xw5i37cidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=612e88c2919519334f328db0fa8242d569f3fb06

I referenced it on my pre-market analysis that we remain within the bear channel still with a now resistance of 440.7 to 441.7 and now support at 431.6 to 430.

Overall we started at the more support side of channel and have now finished more closer to the resistance side but overall we have no solid direction just from the intraday chart. I look for tomorrow to have a confirmed support or confirmed resistance test. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7103hvucidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bdabf47603dae71a8c3d3f26322c3b000d66b7

The intraday volume today was unbelievably low and was saved somewhat by the last 15minute candle but we still finished near 66mil total volume which is the 2nd lowest volume day since April 4th and March 24th. 

As you can see I am working on a theory we are going to bounce off support near 428 to 433 and from there work back to the 450 to 460 range. Arguably we looked poised end of day today to flush to 433 but we ended up reversing at the last minute there. 

We did remain in the bear channel with our next bear channel support at exactly 433.

Bears managed to close a FULL candle below the daily 200ema of 439.96 without even breaking it at all intraday which actually is a fairly bearish move overall and should see a lower push without any bullish sentiment overnight. Markets seemed to have rallied aggressively right at market close though. Being under the 200ema now we really don’t have another support that’s strong which is why I an using the January lows at the next logical support. 

Bulls will look to close back over 440 tomorrow and bears will look to get an even lower close near 433 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Apple too was a victim of sideways trading with a strong $3 range seeing a very similar movement of spy today, but a little less dramatic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9j28a2eidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c4ef3c8f3ecef360d10cc4e5ab5cf9068e4a0b

Apple did manage to close a red candle today (green on chart) but it’s a -0.13% day for Apple. 

Apple was early morning looking very strong ready to hold over its daily 100ema of 165.66 but quickly fell back below it and from there never broke it again. Todays candle for apple closed similarly to the candle from March 14th which is a hammer candle and COULD signal further upside for apple this week ahead. 

Bulls will need apple to close back above the daily 100ema to prevent any further retracements. 

Bears will look to capitalize on this down day with another red candle with a price target of the late January lows of 155 to 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j16myvleidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f88f39c078c10f31e2f062372ebaa0a919efea

QQQ today had a similar day as spy and apple clocking in a small 0.08% green day but seeing a major after market pop. 

Bears were able to make a new recent low for QQQ and will look to continue to capitalize on that this week. The candle closing inside the middle of the channel allows room for both directions easily tomorrow. However, it did finish a large bodies doji. Which after almost two weeks of red could signal a reversal tomorrow for green. 

I mentioned the January lows for apple and spy. QQQ is ahead of the game and today broke below the first low of 338.3 with its final low being 334.5. If we were to see QQQ close below 334.5 this week I would suspect we could see a further sell off down near 318 to 330 in the coming weeks. 

Bulls really need to get a nice green day tomorrow here to be able to break the daily 8ema. Until that resistance is broken QQQ is in some serious red trouble. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q77r0v9fidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=03900796afdfd2d5155de1b5a9b1b9ae5c11f3a5

After a pretty significant gap up at open the VIX spent most of its day unwinding from its high of 24.6 to 21.98 end of day, another 12% range day for the VIX. Seems to be pretty common we have these huge VIX swings. It is slightly surprising with how massively the VIX unwound today that SPY did not have a green day. With the VIX down near its normal level and where it clung to end of last week we should see less volatility tomorrow and again the VIX should be a great guide for action to come. 

10% challenge-

Mondays historically is a day I struggle with profit wise and its probably cause lately Mondays have been anything but “trendy.” Like we saw today, however, I was able to pull 1.5x daily profit goal so I cant be too upset about that at all. Lost a little on an end of day greedy put play but overall a great day despite the weird sideways day we had. 

4dte apple put= -26%

4dte spy call= 12%

4dte spy call= 12%

11dte apple call= -8%

4dte spy put= 20%

4dte spy put= -15%

2dte spy call 10%

Today I also officially began the hyperwheel utilizing the MES futures. I have three current open contracts. Two I sold together are sitting at +32% and one is sitting +12%. Looking to see if we continue the after hours green tonight to be able to roll my first profitable sold put or if we continue downside. I am excited for this venture of the hyper wheel. 

Overall this weekend after digging through the discords theta thread and compiling it all into one document (soon to be available just getting final touches!) I decided it was time to do it heads on. I am currently running 2:1 leverage and feel fairly comfortable with that leverage right now. As I continue day trading and with my monthly goal being $10k plus I was finding myself struggling with an “end goal.” Yes of course goals to be “wealthy” BUT what number? I didn’t have a number and I can only trade so many options and with this market im not comfortable upping my capital. I had plans to VTI and chill all profits but now that my capital has grown significantly I am at a good place to start the hyperwheel. I find the effort worth the reward in the end and I look forward to giving this venture a go. I will be adding my daily hyperwheel progress to my TA from now on for you to track and those who are curious to see it real world.",18.0,u6qx8f,2022-04-18T23:39:02Z,2022-04-18

9022,fb,wallstreetbets,POST,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"Not just for the year, but the upcoming earnings as well.  

Two reasons why:

1) If you were a customer using FB platform to market advertising and you saw what you did in FB's previous earnings, would you continue spending the same amount on advertising when you could spend that on platforms showing new, massive volumes of growth?  **In other words, is the opportunity cost blatantly obvious?** Or do you just stick it out with Facebook assuming that there will be 1) changes to it's other platforms to help bring in new people in/retain them or 2) the metaverse will be the latest and greatest.  Both seem almost like common sense.  The answer is no, neither will happen or be a thing. I'd imagine that their support going into the previous earnings has substantially lowered because of this.  Thus, much less revenue compared to what it previously dropped too.

2) The metaverse will be a epic failure on a level never seen before. It really does show to the world that Zuck doesn't have what it takes to understand what demand is (since he stole the FB idea). I mean really ask yourself this: **Are you going to wear a headset to check social media on your lunch break at work?**  When you wake up? When you're taking a shit.  *At best, for many interested, it's going to be in the evening or maybe over the weekend.*  This means *significant less* coverage time for advertisement compared to the previous model.  Thus, in order to sustain growth and returns for investors (more like prevent people from selling), they announced that each transaction will give FB half of it's value which again, does the complete opposite for maintaining growth.  Especially when other platforms offer a much more realistic model that enables coverage for low charge or completely free.

You tell me, does wearing an oculus headset sound like something you would wear during various periods of the day? How about buying NFTs or digital currency through the platform? What can this model offer that is tangible and worth the value of giving FB half of the cost involved?

Or better yet, would it seem strange to wear an oculus headset while getting coffee near you? How about if you saw someone else doing it? Do you think they can order coffee or stand in line doing this without looking like a weirdo? We've all seen how fucking strange it is to see people doing instagram feeds to show-off a life style they don't have. How about in line at the grocery store? Does that seem fitting and not awkward to do? Because I can tell you right now, ***nobody will do that.*** Not unless they design a model that makes it so that you don't stick out like a weirdo and also function around you.",55.0,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:19:51Z,2022-04-18

9027,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"I've been working with the Occulus since the Kickstarter, and interactivity devices such as hand motion interfaces for ages now, and the thing that gets forgotten is how good the mouse is as a device that augments your motion with minimal movements compared to do arm circles for half an hour in the air. By the same token, the phone is so successful because of its ability to give a (false) sense of being in control by being able to put it in your pocket, and interface by voice or a few fingers taps and limited body movement, and as you've even described a low onramp to usage.

I took a Halolens 2 over to a family get together a few months back. Everyone, even the gamer kids, used it for about 10 min apiece, and it sat there on the counter the rest of the day. Govenrment VR labs mostly sit around begging for work and trying to concoct reasons for people in the military or government to give a shit which tend to fall on deaf ears.

I was so excited for the prospects I kickstarted Occulus and took the DK2 with me around to try with a lot of people, so I get the nerdy interest, but the aforementioned issues result in my halolens, oculus, and other sets mostly just collect dust even from me. I am deeply familiar with a project attempting to bring things to contact lenses, but that is still a ways off. Perhaps metaverse one day, but I don't think anyone trusts one run by Zuck, and I don't think the tech is there to bring it mainstream anytime soon.",21.0,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:33:43Z,2022-04-18

9039,fb,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,I'm extremely bearish on FB.,"The metaverse isn't for you. It will catch on with kids. They'll buy roblux with their parent's cards and decorate their little minecraft houses with their fortnite skins or whatever. Then, when those 10 year olds turn 25 and keep using it, it will eventually start to take off with ""boomers"" (anyone currently over the age of 15).

That's how facebook happened, anyway. All this shit looks like ass until lameass kids start using it and make it popular, at which time you will be old and still complaining that it's just a fad.

There's a reason their tech demo looked like a pixar movie. They're gonna convince parents that they need to buy their kid a VR thing for christmas, the kids will use it to do lame kid shit (think myspace 2005), and eventually it'll just be a thing.

Doesn't change your thesis, since I doubt Facebook will be the one to capitalize. But the metaverse is going to be a thing, because they obviously want to make it a thing (because monetization), and boomers like me and you hating on it just makes it more appealing to the kids.",-3.0,u6l454,2022-04-18T19:43:49Z,2022-04-18

There is a small amount (about 10%) who are dead set that Facebook is the best and will always be, and won't go elsewhere unless forced. Another 10% who know FB has helped them in the past, and are continuing to try while exploring other options. The rest are leaving in droves.

9737,amd,stocks,COMMENT,Not terrifying but potential bad news for Intel and AMD long term,"The old ARM chestnut being trotted out yet again. Alibaba isn’t a serious contender for data center chips right now, but Nvidia is and has released some results on its Grace ARM chip. Those results show it outperforms AMD’s old Epyc Rome chip but noticeably don’t compare it to current Milan chips, implying that it can’t beat the latest Epyc offering and likely won’t be a serious competitor for Genoa or Bergamo when it finally comes out. 

If Nvidia with their vast resources and expertise can’t easily make it work, I don’t buy how this is currently a serious concern.

ARM may have niche use cases outside of bog standard domains and web servers. HaaS for example where the risk is offloaded to the cloud provider. Of course niche doesn't mean small. But AMD will be fine. 

Not to mention they can just get into the space more themselves.

You could have bought a 0dte put or 0dte call at open today and with enough patience been profitable very few days can you say that. So what did we learn from today? 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xw5i37cidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=612e88c2919519334f328db0fa8242d569f3fb06

I referenced it on my pre-market analysis that we remain within the bear channel still with a now resistance of 440.7 to 441.7 and now support at 431.6 to 430.

Overall we started at the more support side of channel and have now finished more closer to the resistance side but overall we have no solid direction just from the intraday chart. I look for tomorrow to have a confirmed support or confirmed resistance test. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7103hvucidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79bdabf47603dae71a8c3d3f26322c3b000d66b7

The intraday volume today was unbelievably low and was saved somewhat by the last 15minute candle but we still finished near 66mil total volume which is the 2nd lowest volume day since April 4th and March 24th. 

As you can see I am working on a theory we are going to bounce off support near 428 to 433 and from there work back to the 450 to 460 range. Arguably we looked poised end of day today to flush to 433 but we ended up reversing at the last minute there. 

We did remain in the bear channel with our next bear channel support at exactly 433.

Bears managed to close a FULL candle below the daily 200ema of 439.96 without even breaking it at all intraday which actually is a fairly bearish move overall and should see a lower push without any bullish sentiment overnight. Markets seemed to have rallied aggressively right at market close though. Being under the 200ema now we really don’t have another support that’s strong which is why I an using the January lows at the next logical support. 

Bulls will look to close back over 440 tomorrow and bears will look to get an even lower close near 433 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/exs29gididu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e2673f5ec3217f43aaaa415ebd2920d80061d0

Apple too was a victim of sideways trading with a strong $3 range seeing a very similar movement of spy today, but a little less dramatic. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w9j28a2eidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31c4ef3c8f3ecef360d10cc4e5ab5cf9068e4a0b

Apple did manage to close a red candle today (green on chart) but it’s a -0.13% day for Apple. 

Apple was early morning looking very strong ready to hold over its daily 100ema of 165.66 but quickly fell back below it and from there never broke it again. Todays candle for apple closed similarly to the candle from March 14th which is a hammer candle and COULD signal further upside for apple this week ahead. 

Bulls will need apple to close back above the daily 100ema to prevent any further retracements. 

Bears will look to capitalize on this down day with another red candle with a price target of the late January lows of 155 to 160.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j16myvleidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1f88f39c078c10f31e2f062372ebaa0a919efea

QQQ today had a similar day as spy and apple clocking in a small 0.08% green day but seeing a major after market pop. 

Bears were able to make a new recent low for QQQ and will look to continue to capitalize on that this week. The candle closing inside the middle of the channel allows room for both directions easily tomorrow. However, it did finish a large bodies doji. Which after almost two weeks of red could signal a reversal tomorrow for green. 

I mentioned the January lows for apple and spy. QQQ is ahead of the game and today broke below the first low of 338.3 with its final low being 334.5. If we were to see QQQ close below 334.5 this week I would suspect we could see a further sell off down near 318 to 330 in the coming weeks. 

Bulls really need to get a nice green day tomorrow here to be able to break the daily 8ema. Until that resistance is broken QQQ is in some serious red trouble. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q77r0v9fidu81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=03900796afdfd2d5155de1b5a9b1b9ae5c11f3a5

After a pretty significant gap up at open the VIX spent most of its day unwinding from its high of 24.6 to 21.98 end of day, another 12% range day for the VIX. Seems to be pretty common we have these huge VIX swings. It is slightly surprising with how massively the VIX unwound today that SPY did not have a green day. With the VIX down near its normal level and where it clung to end of last week we should see less volatility tomorrow and again the VIX should be a great guide for action to come. 

10% challenge-

Mondays historically is a day I struggle with profit wise and its probably cause lately Mondays have been anything but “trendy.” Like we saw today, however, I was able to pull 1.5x daily profit goal so I cant be too upset about that at all. Lost a little on an end of day greedy put play but overall a great day despite the weird sideways day we had.

4dte spy call= 12%

11dte apple call= -8%

4dte spy put= 20%

4dte spy put= -15%

Today I also officially began the hyperwheel utilizing the MES futures. I have three current open contracts. Two I sold together are sitting at +32% and one is sitting +12%. Looking to see if we continue the after hours green tonight to be able to roll my first profitable sold put or if we continue downside. I am excited for this venture of the hyper wheel. 

Overall this weekend after digging through the discords theta thread and compiling it all into one document (soon to be available just getting final touches!) I decided it was time to do it heads on. I am currently running 2:1 leverage and feel fairly comfortable with that leverage right now. As I continue day trading and with my monthly goal being $10k plus I was finding myself struggling with an “end goal.” Yes of course goals to be “wealthy” BUT what number? I didn’t have a number and I can only trade so many options and with this market im not comfortable upping my capital. I had plans to VTI and chill all profits but now that my capital has grown significantly I am at a good place to start the hyperwheel. I find the effort worth the reward in the end and I look forward to giving this venture a go. I will be adding my daily hyperwheel progress to my TA from now on for you to track and those who are curious to see it real world.",17.0,u6qx8f,2022-04-18T23:39:02Z,2022-04-18

I’ve seen „less gifted“ colleagues venting about how they can’t seem to open the scam.exe file they received from claimyourprize@shadydomain.com on their Mac and I sleep a lot better since my mum is using one as well.

That being said - not giving out personal data on the phone, especially passwords is something I’ve made my mum pinky promise me and put on a postit onto her screen. „Don’t trust anyone on the phone.“ if it’s important you can call their public office and get connected yourself - virtually nothing demands a real-time reaction.
