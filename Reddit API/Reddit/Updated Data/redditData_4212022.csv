And they won’t load foreign shows from Scandinavia or Europe, but half the available shows are from India or Mexico/Spain. When are they gonna learn most people in the USA don’t want to watch the stuff coming out of Bollywood?

I believe we are on the cusp of a paradigm change where more people will subscribe to one maybe two streaming channels watch what you like then cancel the sub and move to another one. There is no benefit for being a 20 year Netflix subscriber, so why not replace it with HBO, Amazon Plus, Disney+, Skin-a-max, Peacock, Hulu, etc… watch all the stuff you like and bounce when you find yourself spending too long looking for something you want to watch.",1.0,u7l2v1,2022-04-21T03:00:23Z,2022-04-21

1000,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Anyone else think -29% on NFLX is a bit overdone?!?,"Netflix has lost its way over the years. Originally, it was a disruptor bringing unlimited DVD rentals to consumers via mail for a super low price. Then, disrupting the industry more by moving to streaming. Sadly, a lot of the larger studios whose films likely account for more than HALF of all popular films in existence got smart and decided to launch their own platforms. To combat this, Netflix has been forced to invest HEAVILY in new, original content. While this has worked for the past couple years, the amount of new content (as well as the demand) just cannot keep up with the amount of lost content to other streaming services. If we look back on Netflix's origins with 20/20 hindsight, there really was no ""secret sauce"" so while they were the first to pave the way to affordable, unlimited streaming content, they are also the first to be sacrificed for the other studios/content providers to survive.",2.0,u7w8nr,2022-04-21T00:33:12Z,2022-04-21

2494,gme,GME,COMMENT,Can we get a positions or ban rule for posts with calls to action? Why is someone unwilling to show their positions telling GME investors what to do?,"Calls to action are something that came up last year shortly after the sec gamestop report. If I remember correctly it was something about anonymously reporting the illegal naked shorting and market manipulation to the sec so they were forced to forward it to the doj. Can't find the post, must be deleted. Seeing all those new actions taken by apes I am happy because we are beginning to stand up and raise our voices in a fashion that uses our power in numbers in such a way to force change from within the system. 
Try to look at it this way: those shf and their lawyers never dared to dream about the nightmare we are for their entire system of crime because we learned to use their own system against them while creating more and more pressure with drs and attracting great minds like dlauer, pulte and so on for our great cause.
Their entire mindset was that apes are stupid and crazy but apes proofed that retail is more powerful and smart than their entire network of crime and manipulation can ever be when showed the right direction. Apes already began remodeling the market and system and with moass apes will rebuild it and monitor i5 as it should have been from the get go. One ape showed a tool to the other apes, it worked, and is being refined and used as time goes on. First we learned to buy, then hodl, then we learned to drs, and now we learned how to use the same power that made the tools mentioned before so incredible powerful to complain and shape the rules for a better and fairer market.

Imagine how useful this toolkit will be after moass for the future of the stock market.",0.0,u8462f,2022-04-21T01:51:15Z,2022-04-21

9741,amzn,wallstreetbets,POST,DD - $AMZN 2500 PUTS 4/29,"Amazon will tank on earnings due to 7 factors:

1. Price increase announced in February 16
2. Amazon stock buyback/split announced March 9, 2022
3. Amazon 5% fuel/inflation surcharge announced April 13
4. $JBHT last mile logistics company Q1 results
5. Valuation/growth issues
6. Competition hitting inflection point
7. $UPS earnings 4/26 TBD



1 - Amazon announced a price increase which reflects that internally they are seeing increases costs and likely new member stagnation. Market has likely reached saturation like $NFLX reached.

2 - This is a gambit to create short term hype. If you review FY21 financials they generate no free cash flow (cash from ops - capex - stock based comp). A $10 billion buyback ONLY keeps their share count flat at best. It does not reduce it. (509k -503k = 6k. 6k / 503k = 1.2% dilution. 1.2% dilution on 1.6 trillion market cap means it requires almost $20 billion free cash flow to buyback the stock comp. We know stock split means nothing in reality but it's used to pump up the market on your company.

3 - This is weird that it came out about a month and change after quarter end. Seems like management/board received draft financials and didn't like what they saw. A 5% surcharge is their ""fix"" for future quarters.

4 - $JBHT just had earnings with 33% revenue growth and huge earnings growth. Except ALL of that earnings growth is because they charge a fuel surcharge. Without it they had lower earnings than 2021.

5 - The valuation for a company growing operating cash flow 10-15% would be in the 20x -25x normally. This company hides the fact that they can't create real cash flow using stock based comp and they are granting so much that they now can't buy enough back to even stay at 0 dilution. We may see Amazon only grow high single digits (inflation rate) and the premium does not make sense. Same issue as Netflix.

6 - $TGT, $WMT, $COST and other retailers are doing a much better job of leveraging their local stores with delivery. They can share the delivery price burden with their retail store sales and absorb more costs. TGT is growing at the same revenue year over year as $AMZN as of FY 20 to FY 21.

7 - Watch $UPS earnings to get an idea of how the costs of delivery were in Q1. This will give us more insight into what to expect for $AMZN.

I am risk averse so putting like 1% of my boomer portfolio into $2500 Puts. If I am right I expect a COVID roundtrip back to $2100 by the end of the month. I expect $2400 to be the realistic initial sell-off. At $2400 you make $250-$300 into $10k so risk/reward is there. I will have a few thousand worth. Have $1k so far but will add as we get closer and likely after $UPS earnings.

Biggest risk is that I DO think AWS will continue to do well AND I think capex for AWS may be cheaper than expected (Check GPU/CPU prices dropping everywhere and becoming readily available).

For chart fiends there is NO volume between $3k and $2400.

For street cred on financials: My day job is income tax manager for 20+ billion revenue public company.

Edit: 2 new items brought to my attention. They will mark to market their Rivian loss which could trip up the algos that trade on headline #s. Also, $FDX earnings are out and guidance was not good.",78.0,u8atpk,2022-04-21T00:33:09Z,2022-04-21
