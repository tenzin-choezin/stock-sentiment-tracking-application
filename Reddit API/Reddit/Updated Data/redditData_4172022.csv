1830,tsla,investing,POST,Thanks to Margin I made $300k in TSLA but I don’t like margin calls. Wouldn’t a home equity loan be better?,"It sucked when brokerage sold part of my positions when TSLA dropped 20% then recovered in a few days but not prior to Fidelity selling some of my position. 

To avoid this shouldn’t a home equity loan be a better choice? No margin call and lower interest rate ! Yes I know about collateral risk I’ve considered that so don’t waste your time schooling me into a risk I’m willing to take.

Home equity loan better to margin loan? What’s your experience?",0.0,u5odbb,2022-04-17T14:39:03Z,2022-04-17

Yes I should have never bought TSLA on margin, hard to sleep, I did $300,000 unrealized profit in Nov 2021 when TSLA reached $1,200 but now I’m back to even with TSLA at $850 which is approx my cost basis.

Paying $1,500 a month on margin interest……hence the idea to sell covered calls to offset that interest while waiting for TSLA to jump back to $1,200 then I will close my position.""

If you did a home equity loan, you best make sure to stay out of margin. No doubt Tesla will be going up YoY, but there seems to always be a major dip once a year.",2.0,u5odbb,2022-04-17T22:24:51Z,2022-04-17

**TL;DR:**

* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"". (We may need to work backwards from which funds bought GME shares, and look more at long/short equity funds from the past 2 years.)**

For the culture: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u\_r7aLKWi4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u_r7aLKWi4)

So I recently got reported to Reddit Care Resources (only the 2nd time so far), and had no idea what for. Maybe it was this Puerto Rico comment here, repeating the fact that hedge funds fucked over post-Hurricane Maria Puerto Rico loading it up with shitty finance products because since they are a territory (and not a US state) their bankruptcy rules play to banks/hedge fuck's favor: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u5n8hp/bcg\_and\_puerto\_rico/i53zz84/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u5n8hp/bcg_and_puerto_rico/i53zz84/?context=3). (I responded that if that was the case then BCG/Citadel should eat a bag of syphilitic dicks.)

Or maybe it was a comment about BCG saying they're fucked hahhhddd

&#x200B;

[No idea if accurate but why the fuck not](https://preview.redd.it/s1ciw3x356u81.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=4681754bf56347103aeefb75690fc4fc8aec3d58)

Either way, getting reported pissed me the fuck off.

SO here's my fuck you to whoever did it. Made me wanna research something to piss even more of you cunts off. Here's what I found.

&#x200B;

Say hi to Boston Partners.

Patrick Regan (ex-Westfield Capital & Broadview International LLC) and Robert Jones (ex-Boston Company Asset Management) manage the portfolio for Boston Partners' Long/Short Equity Fund (mutual fund ticker: BPSLX). The fund deals with all caps (micro to large) and currently has 200+ equity holdings.

&#x200B;

**Now guess what one of them was back in Sept. 2021?**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**One of their largest short holdings was GME back in Q3 2021, making up 1.3% of their portfolio.** TSLA by comparison was 2.1%, but remember that's a huge large cap stock.

You can see their sector weightings too: consumer discretionary (where GME would prob fit) was 10.8% of their total short portfolio ([https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2021/10/ab3b476d750e375b6aab0cdd0e32bde8/bostonpartners\_longshort\_portfoliomanagercall-093021.pdf](https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2021/10/ab3b476d750e375b6aab0cdd0e32bde8/bostonpartners_longshort_portfoliomanagercall-093021.pdf))

Just kidding. This isn't the end of it.

We've seen Boston Partners before actually thanks to an awesome find by u/callmeputty back around last year on May 7th, 2021: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6y6fh/gme\_ownership\_changes\_refinitiv\_eikon\_news\_may\_07/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/n6y6fh/gme_ownership_changes_refinitiv_eikon_news_may_07/)

&#x200B;

[I see up Boston Partners](https://preview.redd.it/ftfpr9s956u81.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e99a2f91598090427efb5dffa6ecef1cecdc449)

>""Other institutional investors have also modified their holdings of the company. Seven Eight Capital LP **bought a new stake** in GameStop in the fourth quarter worth about $236,000. **Boston Partners increased** its holdings in shares of GameStop by 11.7% in the 4th quarter. Boston Partners now owns 85,058 shares of the company's stock valued at $1,602,000 after **purchasing an additional 8,915 shares** during the period.

&#x200B;

Now at worst, this doesn't seem like it causes anyone's eew eew llams to twitch but it does to me. And why the fuck is that?

&#x200B;

Because this ties into perfectly with what I saw with ANOTHER long/short equity fund, namely Cooper Creek Partners in my ""Irish Goodbye Pt. 2"": [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sy9u5v/the\_irish\_goodbye\_pt\_2\_quilters\_queeftastic\_qualm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sy9u5v/the_irish_goodbye_pt_2_quilters_queeftastic_qualm/)

You can see the TL;DR above but long story short (heh) I found that

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/40f4urkq66u81.png?width=979&format=png&auto=webp&s=1945c1f5073c69f0c3e7f0a8f64eb52c6e4713a9

* C**ooper Creek Partners had a ""long/short"" fund (just like Boston Partners above) that was short GME during the sneeze through a Morgan Stanley total return swap. Cooper Creek includes an ex-Citadel Surveyor Capital fucker named Joe Roskowski.**

&#x200B;

[Say hiiii Cooper Creek](https://preview.redd.it/niuu2hs766u81.png?width=1277&format=png&auto=webp&s=c585f9018a3d411a145fc73bcf4fd99e2b381b19)

* After the sneeze, they reported that they ""covered"" (BUT NOT CLOSED) positions in that fund post-sneeze:

>“As part of our risk management, we covered approximately half of the position on 26 January and the rest on 27 January. **We also had two other short situations, which had become retail frenzy darlings and also experienced unprecedented moves due to the Reddit/Robinhood craze. We fully covered both of those positions as well.**  
>  
>In addition to covering these names, we exited four more small-cap short positions and cut three additional small-cap short positions in half just in case the retail community went after them next. These short situations in aggregate cost the Sub-Fund over 6% in January.”

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2a114sw176u81.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08dc82af121271553e6f7ea181f3bc417cf30f3

&#x200B;

* One of its Cooper Creek's biggest supporters who also INVESTED in said fund that was short GME was called Quilter PLC.

So Quilter PLC not only is a HUGE backer of this long/short fund that was shorting GME THROUGHHH the fucking sneeze, but then guess what they did a bit after? All credit goes to u/pdwp90 for finding that Quilter RANDOMLY bought 1800+ shares of GME last August 2021:

&#x200B;

[Quilter adding +1800 shares of GME months after being short it ](https://preview.redd.it/zqno56g476u81.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=b32b3b1d4976a209697003ee373df1fc5b1de6a7)

So why the fuck does this get me hype?

**Once (Cooper Creek Partners) is an anomaly, twice (Boston Partners) starts to be a fucking pattern. This now ends up being the SECOND time that not only was a long/short equity fund shorting GME through or after the sneeze, but then an associated party buys up GME shares around the same time.**

But what happened to Boston Partners' short position in Q4 2021? ([https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2022/01/5c52a346ee2d603222d9f33ea749aac0/bostonpartners\_longshortportfoliomanagercall-123121.pdf](https://www.boston-partners.com/uploads/2022/01/5c52a346ee2d603222d9f33ea749aac0/bostonpartners_longshortportfoliomanagercall-123121.pdf))

Gone. All of the same top short holdings are there, except for GME.

I've been going down this rabbit hole past few weeks (sorry haven't been posting as much as busy with shit!) but one of the angles I've been seeing is this

1. **We need to work backwards. We need to look at who has BOUGHT shares of GME as it may not just be them being bullish on GME but perhaps offsetting an invisible short position we don't know about (Like Quilter perhaps, who bought GME shares mid August then sold them right after)**
2. **We need to look at LONG/SHORT equity funds. Cooper Creek and Boston Partners are not the only ones that must have had not just short equity holdings (like Boston Partners) but also total return swaps (like Creek's with Morgan) on GME**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"". (We may need to work backwards from which funds bought GME shares, and look more at long/short equity funds from the past 2 years.)**

It encouraged more investment in the company and more spending from customers leading to increased profits and return on investment. Win, win, win. 
Could GME offer something similar? I think it would encourage huge profit overnight whilst rewarding those supporting the company.

In addition it would encourage shareholders to hodl as the only way they can take advantage of the discount is if they keep holding their position.

Today, I moved 250km away from home to another country for my graduation internship. (I'm European if that wasn't clear enough lol) Now, I'm not one to be very dramatic. I've been away from home many times, but never when I had a stable relationship with my girlfriend. Pre-covid I went backpacking a lot and I met her just before the COVID sneeze. She dropped me off today and I miss her already, obviously, but I know I have to bear through it. The internship will be life changing for the both of us and she is so supportive! 

Now, I have never been so grateful for this community and GME. I'm so looking forwards to watching the ticker with everyone and read all the shenanigans on this sub. It even calmed me down thinking about it, been watching GME for more than a year and it has become my pillar of support. Takes away some anxiety and it takes my mind off things. Hedgies and MSM cannot take that away from me ever, they can bash us all they want, but we have created an awesome community that brings joy and support to everyone that lands in the sub.

Thank you guys, I can start this new period of my life with less stress and anxiety because of you! 

Sorry if this does not belong here. I needed to tell this to you guys, because I am sure this sub is a pillar of support to a lot of us.",85.0,u5ttik,2022-04-17T19:06:12Z,2022-04-17

6406,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,GME is a pillar of support while my life changes!,Absolutely agree. Been on GME since late 2020 but didn’t discover Reddit SS until maybe 9 months ago. Having shares and reading all the DD here has literally lifted me out of 4 years of depression. The buzz I get from everything about GME and when the market opens/closes and watching AH etc etc. To be part of all this is the best feeling ever,7.0,u5ttik,2022-04-17T21:07:08Z,2022-04-17

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Apes with shares in brokers that will not DRS, such as Etoro and T212 : think about selling and re-buying elsewhere!! They don’t have shares anyway, so selling hurts nothing.

May it be possible for the company to deliver those additional shares (the stock dividend) in a blockchain matter (What I mean: the company could ask their shareholders, if they want immediately get new shares or - alternatively and maybe better - if they want to get NFTs representing those shares)? 

This would possibly open up another market, which would coexist with the other existing ones ... - is this imaginable and legally enforceable?

6440,gme,Superstonk,POST,Interesting inside view from an Investmentbanker on GME 💎💎⚡️⚡️,"I’m a lawyer and I have a buddy from university days who moved to the dark side and has been working for investment banks for the past 10 years now with Nomura.
I obviously despised of his choice and was never shy of telling him but beside being a greedy bastard talented in making a shitload of money he is a really smart guy and overall a decent guy.

We live in different cities so don’t have frequent contact but when I met him last summer and was mentioning that I’m invested in GME I got the obvious talk. Basically he was laughing about me, saying that I should know better and that there is no way for individual investors to win against Wallstreet and I should say good bye to my money bla bla bla.

Now here is the interesting plot twist. When I met him again last Friday we naturally touched on GME again but his view has surprisingly changed.
Basically he was saying that in general his thesis stands that there is no way that individual investors would stand a chance against the monetary and lobbying power of institutions. For that reason the VW squeeze doesn’t fit as a role model as it was Porsche, a global company who screwed the shorters and not apes hence the situation can’t be compared.

Since Shitadel & friends have an unlimited tool box of screwing around and bending the rules and play countless shenanigans they could drag this staring contest out forever. Sure it costs them some money but they’ll get it back tenfold by screwing over some other individual investors on other stocks. And obviously we shouldn’t base any hopes on the SEC and regulators to have any interest to intervene in the GME fraud since this is part of the game and would jeopardize the whole market game.

So the only chance to bring them down would be a catalyst which forces their hands.

And that’s what he thinks we just got with GameStop’s announcement of the split. He said any stock split could be a catalyst but even more so a split via stock dividend will inevitable create huge pressure and troubles for the shorties. He further went on to say the perfect storm would be if big players with enough fire power would create a gamma ramp by buying a reasonable number of options at any 10 bucks price point above 200 it would be very likely game over and highly difficult for shorties to stop the train once it’s moving full steam. 

And this time they wouldn’t dare to intervene by switching off buy buttons again or some similar shady stuff as they know they are under watch and that would create a turmoil.
He finished in saying everyone in the investment business is aware of the situation and closely following how this will play out and it is not unlikely that some players will want to take advantage and board the train.

Just some irrelevant jibber jabbers and obviously nothing new for us but I thought it’s interesting to share that change of view from someone from the dark side with my fellow apes and to share the joy that dumb money is on the verge to beat smart money 💎💎⚡️⚡️

[Edit: frankly I’m speechless how many people/comments are freaking out over the mentioning of options even though it’s just a side note of the conversation and it explicitly refers to INSTITUTIONAL investors and does by no means encourage any ape to buy options like it generally doesn’t encourage anyone to do anything at all.


But I guess as usual some people just always enjoy to pick on whatever suits them or their agenda…
I don’t mind the impressive number of downvotes, whatever makes some of you happy, but seriously guys, so much negativity and hate from some people on such a harmless post…it’s just the irrelevant opinion of someone irrelevant shared by another someone irrelevant. 

To the vast majority of fellow apes though thank you for your kind support much appreciated - you deserve an epic MOASS 😎]",8755.0,u5klwf,2022-04-17T10:48:52Z,2022-04-17

I do believe that Wall St is capable of some extraordinary fuckery, but they cannot fuck with MY shares in MY name because they are DRS'ed.

I have a $2,000 buy pending. I have a recurring buy with CS every two weeks, and anytime I have leftover money, I will buy more, directly via CS. They CANNOT fuck with that.

Trust Ryan Cohen and trust all the diamond handed investors out there.

I have nothing to lose. What happens if I lose the $30-60k that I have saved up? I delay my opportunity to buy a house? I am middle class. My life is going to be hard forever. Might as well roll the dice and try to fuck with the greedy 1%.",472.0,u5klwf,2022-04-17T13:48:34Z,2022-04-17

You just try to f* the little guy more than what your competition does. However if yourself or your competition is underwater then this rule goes out of the window. GS did  this in '08, pretty sure that there are a lot of people that would like to hurt these guys. Once rumor, that some institutions are hurting badly, is out people would love to jump on board and buy the stonk.
Sadly SS has to do the work to push institutions underwater. Its a honor to have RC doing gods work trying to save healthy companies and expose crime.
Will this play out? Who knows... Odds were always against us... But this is more of a booster for APES... This info is what creates diamond hands... Against the odds with constant education and willing to investigate their desperate moves we are closer than ever. Noone talks about the conspiracy theories anymore. Now its ""it will not have an effect"". There is so much to learn.

Why would the authorities do anything because when they do they would screw themselves.
The only way this can get resolved is if the shorts are forced to close. Everytime the price goes up a lot they push it down, Everytime good news comes out they push it down.
I know MOASS will come, but what this whole thing has taught me is that usual catalysts for stocks don't apply to GME. We need something big and i think the stock split dividend might be it.

6469,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Interesting inside view from an Investmentbanker on GME 💎💎⚡️⚡️,"I appreciate you sharing. 
  
Had a discussion with a friend as well last year, in what sounds like similar situation to you/your friend actually (less frequent contact as we moved to different cities over many years). He works in IB - deriv. trading with ETFs etc. is a genuinely good guy (perhaps despite his profession), and I think he is someone playing by the rules. He was enthusiastic about my interest in this stuff and encouraging about learning more. 
  
Anyways….here’s my experience if you’re curious.
  
What sticks out was my question about the borrow rate. It was such a low rate, and yet so few shares had been available for such a long time. And it was still so heavily shorted (even if the SI% was lowered, I was essentially theorizing to him that they were naked shorting the stock etc., which, well, Citadel as a MM can do “legally”…others not so much…). He didn’t really disagree with any of that, but did make a point to state that naked shorting is illegal and that *he* cannot borrow a share unless he had a hard locate etc. (He plays by the rules of course.)

  
So, I was asking him what he thought about the borrow rate of the stock at the time, and why it was so low given that so few shares are available, and that the stock was clearly still being heavily shorted. 
  
He thought about it for a second and his response was essentially some hypotheticals: 
  
-	the first being rehypothecation. 
-	The second was that they had to give a *little* bit of a discount, otherwise people would just go to Goldman. 
  
(Cue scene from the big short in the ratings office). 
   
I do think he was simply trying to indicate that they have to offer rates competitive to their competition, etc., but my mind couldn’t help going back to that scene.

I also think it was a bit ‘funny’ given goldman’s past experience getting caught shorting using the magical F3 key (IIRC this was documented in a FINRA violation). However, IIRC Goldman makes a TON of their revenue from shorting, more than most, so, again, this last part is all kind of anecdotal/theorizing/spitballing on my end.

Anyways, your post makes me wonder if I should ping him and ask him what he thinks about the share dividend…I just need to figure out how to word it since it’s been a while…",25.0,u5klwf,2022-04-17T13:13:41Z,2022-04-17

For now, Hedgies drop the price and then make the price go sideways, it's not because they're struggling to make the price go further down, it's because they're waiting for volatility to go down and load up on puts for cheap . Low volatility= cheaper option contracts. Hate it or not, a stock split can be the perfect catalyst to use call options and build a gamma ramp. I'm studying this shit and idk, buying calls for next week is retarded, but for June/July during the time the announcement is made seems like a strategy.

And you can look at my comment history; for over half a year I've been saying that we need some sort of a catalyst (DRSing enough shares is what I was using) and then the options ramp is the killshot.

A lawyer calling an investment banker as to the darkside. That's ironic.


If the Finance Committee didn't result in any punitive action, the belief that some big players will take shorties out and Citadel is laughable.  They did it in broad daylight. They all pointed the finger at each other. They will do it again. And blame each other again. 


As soon as Citadel received the green light, KG was giving public intvs. As an attorney, you would know their team of lawyers green lit it.


Not only that. If you believe big players would force a squeeze, that would be market manipulation. Citadel would litagate the shit out of them.

If this was a sure bet, whales and institutions in the know would've already jumped all in at once to apply short squeeze pressure.

Sadly algorithms and programs control the stock exchanges. Weve seen that fundamentals mean nothing. Sure, retailers can cause some change in price due to sentiment but prices are controlled within parameters that benefit the fucking Citadels of the world. Mark my words no matter what anyone does...RC or Elon, Pulte, etc. as long as Citadel has the computing intelligence and and are intwined with the framework of the exchanges, what should happen will always be left as what shouldve happened.",0.0,u5klwf,2022-04-17T14:55:05Z,2022-04-17

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",1338.0,u5hjar,2022-04-17T07:00:10Z,2022-04-17

**Is there something in the Boston water? 1st State Street's XRT, then BCG, now meet Boston Partners! Their Long/Short Fund was short GME back in Sept. 2021.**

**TL;DR:**  


* **Boston Partners had a long/short equity fund that was short GME in Q3 2021. This then disappears as one of their top 5 shorts in their Q4 report, all while it bought up GME shares in May 2021.**
* **It echoes something I saw with Cooper Creek Partners having a long/short equity fund that was short GME with a Morgan Stanley Total return swap, where one of its supporters/buyers (Quilter PLC) ended up buying shares of GME months after Cooper said they ""covered positions"". (We may need to work backwards from which funds bought GME shares, and look more at long/short equity funds from the past 2 years.)**",7.0,u5hjar,2022-04-17T23:19:35Z,2022-04-17

6967,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Cats? This is my miracle baby! Spent 3 weeks at the vet and cost me about 55 GME shares but she's totally worth it. Meet Twinkle.,"Anyone who's wondering:

She was given to me to foster and when she arrived I told the person that she was actively dying. Her breathing was extremely rattled and she could barely hold her head up.

Person told me she had an upper respiratory infection and was on meds. I took her immediately to the emergency center at the vet since it was 11pm.

Turns out she had pneumonia in all 4 lung lobes. The vet that was there said she probably wouldn't survive the night. To be honest, they were all really rude about the whole thing but after 3 weeks she was allowed to come home on continued breathing treatments 8x a day. She had to sit in a box that I would pump with some kind of vapor medication for her to breathe in. 

After a month of that she finallly stopped coughing and hacking stuff up. She's the cutest fucking cat I've ever had.

7002,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Both. I tend to invest in GME with income, but I also invest in other securities that I find are far undervalued or are long term dividend plays. The dividends were getting reinvested into their respective companies, but I started cashing them out and buying GME during it's downward trend. I know we're all about 100% in around here, but as long as the hedgies are playing in other parts of the market I'll keep fighting them on all fronts.

That being said, SPY/S&P have been on a downward trend all year. Could be a bear trap, it's definitely been lower YTD; but with the fed hikes confusing everyone future outlook looks bleak. I find a lot of stocks (Tesla, Chipotle, AMZN for examples) are far overvalued IMO; but as long as the feds keep pumping the market it doesn't appear to matter to anyone else. I've been closing out most of my other positions that aren't long term divvy holds in preparation for a recession. I'm even thinking about closing those out since GME is going to be offering divvies (Thanks RC!)

The problem I have with a lot of dividend companies is if we face a stagflation/deflation scenario the dividends may be removed; coupled with the possibility of a stock devaluation into loss territory for 5-20 years I don't want to be stuck in a long term losing position. Everything else, and I do mean *everything* else is going to take a very hard hit if we even hit just a recession. (GME long term and swap basket short term discluded, there's a few other outliers that may stay afloat as well)

7003,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Your only going to get mostly one response here.  Most are 100% GME.  Shorts did not close their positions last year, and the vast evidence since Jan 2021 shows they have only multiplied their short position. 

No hedge fund/analyst in the world seen the Gamestop fundamentals turnaround brought on by Ryan Cohen.  GME has become a win/win and will burn shorts to the ground.  They expected retail to give up on this play a loong time ago.  I feel confident saying that after all the fuckery exposed this past year,  most here would rather their position go to zero than sell and let these guys cover. 

My opinion?  We don't do financial advice here, but GME has huge short term upside with June split vote and mass buy in if split is expected 7-1, and huge long term potential with the platforms currently under construction.   I'm personally 90%+ GME.  Not 100% because i recieve bi-weekly company stock for my own employer. Would be 100% if that was not the case.",8.0,u5bx9k,2022-04-17T03:13:28Z,2022-04-17

7049,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,Sell AAPL for GME?,"Not financial advice but Yes.

Think about it in terms of Market Cap, and what you are trying to accomplish (50%, 100%, 200% etc). AAPL is around a $2.7 TRILLION Market Cap at the moment. So for you to double your money on that investment (100%), AAPL Cap would have to grow by $2.7 Trillion. Definitely possible, but how long will it take? 10 years?

Now look at GME little $11 Billion Market Cap, which many could make the case that this will be a $100 Billion+ Market Cap stock within a few years (with or without the Sneeze). IMO it’s much higher of a chance we see $100 Billion MC in a short period of time with GME, than we will see $5 Trillion+ Market Cap with AAPL.

TLDR: your chances of doing 1000%+ gain on GME are much higher than your chance of ever seeing 100% return on AAPL based on Market Cap alone.",2.0,u5bx9k,2022-04-17T05:03:08Z,2022-04-17

The way I thought about it is that no matter how great those companies are and how much I want to own them none of those companies have the same asymmetric risk/reward profile GME does, the odds of them increasing more than 5X over 5 years is pretty low and tbh I personally think 5X up in price from here on GME isn’t even the start of MOASS considering I saw it hit $500 in premarket the day they turned off the buy button and started engaging in all this fuckery.

I was just browsing the internet to see when was the last time **one of the finest investors of his generation** filed a 13F on GameStop. Initially, I couldn't find anything, but the moment I entered $GME's CUSIP, this website popped up: [https://13f.info/manager/0001628110/cusip/36467W109](https://13f.info/manager/0001628110/cusip/36467W109) 

For the ape's who don't want to click the website, here is what you see:

In fintel, all Melvin's GME position is locked (I ain't paying for that). Also, they show a -100 with a File Date of 2021-05-17.

The scary part is that Melvin had around 6 million puts (I couldn't find any calls)  in 2020 Q4. So at Gamestop's January peak, Melvin was down $1,950,000,000 ? If not for Kenneth Griffin and Steven Cohen, Gabe would've been really screwed.",116.0,u5axdj,2022-04-17T00:15:41Z,2022-04-17

Many software products are produced with a benign intend; Bringing information together, turning it into a consistent whole, allowing easy dissection of the data, verifying it against benchmarks, nicely presenting the results, etc, are all simply tools to facilitate end users, making their jobs easier, getting accurate results faster.
Up to this point, nothing much seems wrong with that.

But the same tools will likely also have issues like privacy concerns, security, authorisation and authentication requirements, journaling and other stuff that could easily go wrong (without ill intent). And even worse (but nearly impossible to control by the producer) is when such software tools are used for questionable applications, with objectives that could cause harm instead of help - THAT'S when problems start.

So, when problems do arise, the human element is often much more important than the actual software itself. Just saying.",2.0,u56jxl,2022-04-17T14:43:34Z,2022-04-17

TL;DR

Anyone or groups crossing the 15% boundary would get diluted into infinity and the courts have already widely accepted this as 'not *ultra vires.* ' meaning it **is within one's legal power**

The DOJ and SEC are going after Musk already

The media and side-ies are ramping up anti-Elon propaganda, and have been for months.

This was exactly why.

**If you are a twitter bag holder you only really have one hope imho, and that's someone they trust (like maybe Bezos?) steps in (probably unlikely),** also maybe Twitter finds a backer to take themselves private or some other mysterious shit.. also bad for Twitter (as was Elon ever being serious or trolling about touching anything there)

This would fuck your puts but the risk/reward looks great

# If I Gave You A Coin That Pays You 3:1 How Many Times Would You Flip It

In my strongest of opinions, Twitter is a 5th gen weapon and it will be salted and scorched Earth before ever being turned over.

Employees quit/fired/boycott and evacuated before building demolished, servers destroyed and wiped, logo trademark sold, and the ground burned and salted. Then Elon is smeared as bad or worse than Mango himself along with the company name. Then the only thing that would ever be turned over is the name. Twitter. Share price infinitively diluted and reversed split to 0bid - 0.01 ask.

Cellar Boxed and burned

# One More Update

Elon is teasing Tender offer, this may ensue more aggressive scorched Earth approach in the near term worries for massive dilution if they are in fear of him seriously getting too close.

Elon may just trigger the Pill for the lulz on 4/20 (weds)

**It is your WSB duty to tell every retard you see that is clueless, that they are getting diluted and diluted more if they are buying a dip in hopes of out bidding an infinite poison pill and/or scorched Earth provision.**

I still see people not getting it. We'll get there before premarket Monday.

See you at the bottom

If he gets twitter, he gets twitter. If twitter burns there own house down, so elon does not get it. He gets to sue the SEC for alowing the twitter board to make choices against the best intrest of investors.

He then used that to purchase his stake in twitter. A lot of twitters stock is tied up with institutions as well.  I personally think that he doesn't have the money to buy it. He simply put twitter in a situation where there market cap will be reduced due to them implementing various strategies to avoid a hostile takeover. This could allow him to buy even more of twitter at a discounted rate as institutions pull out in fear of their investment losing money.

7955,twtr,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Mark Cuban thinks Elon plans to sell $TWTR for a profit,"hey Mark? what's worse than an idiot with an opinion?

A) 

An idiot with money to buy a sports team but doesn't think about consequences 

Elon has the money so he was locked in that offer UNTIL the offer is either accepted or flat rejected (a flat rejection being ""there's no way further offers will be fruitful"") because if he makes offer then cashes out that's against the law (aka "" Pump & Dump"" what is what Cuban's possibly libelous accusation is suggesting)

Instead, Elon has a beautifully choreographed path to either let Trump back into the tweeter-verse OR take a few billion$ from AMERICAN-HATING LEFTISTS.

the (illegal, due to fiduciary  responsibilities) ""offer"" of instituting a poison pill thus rejecting Elon's offer flat now allows Elon to dump without warning and possibly even gain 14.9% stake by re-buying at the lower price (after the dump brings price closer the suggested $30 value)

if Elon does re-buy a dump... (he'll limit it to 14.9% to prevent the poison pill from kicking in)  look for  A LOWER OFFER and the resulting lawsuits due the fiduciary duty to have voted on the higher offer instead of scuttling it.

after that?

if after dust clears and still no positive result(for Elon), i expect Elon will dump all again (and maybe later buy to just under minimum report level)",2.0,u3mft7,2022-04-17T13:42:34Z,2022-04-17

8594,spy,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Timing a Recession? [$SPY - Predictions for the week of 4/18],"We need to remember that the thesis for bond yield analysis as a recession predictor is based on two things:

 \- The idea that bond yield differences and changes reflect investor sentiment.

 \- The fact that banks draw in capital from bond yield spread.

Both of these require normal market conditions and constrained cash reserves... but right now the Fed is actively manipulating the bond market and will be for the foreseeable future in a way that doesn't correlate to any other time in history, and banks are absolutely swimming in cash reserves right now.

As a result, the normal assumptions for their relationship to larger macroeconomic recessions are broken. Now I'm not saying that we will/won't have one... I can't see the future... just saying that bond considerations need to be balanced with this in mind and against other macroeconomic factors, many of which point away from there being a recession at the moment.",5.0,u57ukd,2022-04-17T05:13:02Z,2022-04-17

9702,amd,stocks,COMMENT,AMDs latest acquisitions,"I can't say I understand Xilinx much more than what AMD is letting on - i.e. gives access to the 5G and vehicle markets, as well as Xilinx having strong AI inference capability over Nvidia. Also best practices for AI will change over time, so Xilinx's programmability may allow units to adapt to new practices without designing new chips, also allows for prototyping faster during these changes.

In terms of Pensando, my understanding is that it allows AMD to flesh out their network offerings to compete with Nvidia's Bluefield and Intel's IPU. How important is the tech that allows Pensando to offer something that is 5-10x better than AWS Nitro, I don't know or understand.

What I do feel strongly about is that AMD has now recruited people that are the top of their fields in terms of leadership, innovation and expertise - Victor Peng from Xilinx, MPLS team from Cisco. I don't really know who David Wong is (not that I know any of them personally, haha), but I guess we'll see how RDNA3 turns out.

The people who run and direct the organizations are really important. You can have talented and smart engineers but if they aren't motivated or allowed to blossom, then the whole company will go down the drain. It's pretty important to understand that it's the employees that do the engineering, but the direction and guidance and direction set by strong and experienced leadership is equally important.

9707,amd,stocks,COMMENT,AMDs latest acquisitions,"I’m guessing is a way to compete with nvidia who is also making some moves beyond gpu.

As google and Apple  dwells more into making its own cpus and maybe Microsoft and their artificial intelligence it’s something these cpu makers might be trying to think ahead so they don’t end up in a Facebook type scenario where their eggs relied too much in apples or any one companies ecosystems. Right now they rely a lot on Microsoft for gaming, servers Os, and Xbox. Microsoft decides to go the Apple way and could be bad for amd and nvidia. 

And amd seems to be preparing to work more in its own SOC. 
But on her one words it’s about adaptive computing capabilities. 
Which seems to be about making one fast chip to power everything instead of having different  components like cpu here and gpu there etc. 
And it adapts to what’s needed. 

So if it’s for a gamer then inside it’ll use more power for graphics but if it’s server then not.
Apples silicon still has different components inside even though it’s one chip. I think amd is aiming at a way to have all components working the same but it’s a different tech where there woudnt be any difference between cpu or gpu .

Not sure of course, but if it’s true then her statement of being able to capture some of that cloud server market as programs and even operating systems are migrating to the cloud. Therefore a gamer might need more graphic power than a normal server so those potential new amd chips would do everything at once.
Or something along those lines. 

AMD is also looking for data centers and even virtual reality. Which in some futuristic sci-fi scenario you’d have the meta verse being streamed into your VR headset and a lot of grunt  work would be coming from the cloud servers.
Therefore the same chip powering both the computer in the cloud and the VR headset would make sense instead of custom chip for everything. 

So basically preparing to stream games from the cloud into peoples VR headset in the meta verse. And make sure companies use amd servers instead of AWS. 
I think that’s the main plot. Grab some of that Amazon server market to later not rely on any one platform or company for whatever tech comes next.",4.0,u5sbq0,2022-04-17T22:40:06Z,2022-04-17

The data in CRM systems for sales is basically worthless because no one maintains the data in it. I see companies with Salesforce deployments who after 3 to 5 years literally are deleting everything in their instance and refilling it with a smaller but new dataset. They have so many products and few of them are well developed. Salesforce will still be used at a lot of companies in 10 years but I suspect their growth will stop in the next few years. Salesforce is really like a crappy low code platform for a lot of companies but other, better platforms are coming out. Palantir, Snowflake, Podio, iPAAS and other apps are all great examples of companies taking custom app mindshare away from custom Salesforce apps.

CRM is basically like IBM. No one got fired for buying IBM consulting and same idea for Salesforce. But that isn't a great growth story. CRM trades at a 127 PE ratio and IBM trades at a 12 PE ratio.",2.0,u4dsoz,2022-04-17T05:00:05Z,2022-04-17

We are over a year past the sneeze and all we have are a few senate hearings that lead to... what? Meanwhile, he deflects to climate change when we're focused on Payment For Order Flow. (Notice how Jon Stewart did a ""The Problem"" show on climate change and recycling RIGHT AFTER TALKING WITH GARY GENSLER, showing how a lot of the climate change stuff that's pushed onto the common person is bupkis and the big corpos are the driving force behind it. It all comes full circle.)

I still think we need to be submitting research and information to the SEC. At the end of the day, that research, that Due Diligence, will be CRITICAL in showing how useless and ineffective the SEC is, how fraudulent the FED is, and how we need big change in all of these systems. Without submitting the DD to the SEC in as dumbed-down a way as possible, congress can sweep all this under the rug. Every page and comment sent the SEC's way about issues like short selling, naked shorting, payment for order flow, dark pools, and more, is another day that Kenneth Cordele Griffin of Citadel, Steve Cohen of Point 72 and more will spend behind bars and another nail in the coffin for the ineffective SEC.",2.0,u5f754,2022-04-17T21:26:14Z,2022-04-17

10334,appl,CryptoCurrency,POST,"Security Warning - If you use MetaMask on an iOS device with iCloud backup enabled, then your vault seed is automatically backed up by default. People are being phished for AppleID resets with one victim losing $650K yesterday.","**TL:DR** 

If you have MetaMask on an iPhone or Mac, then you're likely also using iCloud backup.  MetaMask backup your Valut containing your seed by default, so turn that off from Settings\\Profile\\iCloud\\Manage Storage!

&#x200B;

**Summary**

I have been following this developing story on Twitter about a user that lost $650K yesterday due to the following phishing method with others coming forward claiming that the same has also happened to them.

**Background**  

When you create a wallet using MetaMask on an iPhone, the app will create a JSON containing your wallet, this is stored on your device.  Most users use iCloud to automatically backup their phone and app data, but unbeknown to many users, MetaMask include this file as part of the backup.  From a google search, this isn't new, it was discovered in 2019, but MetaMask have today acknowledged (addressed) it [HERE](https://nitter.net/MetaMask) after a number of users were targeted resulting in lost funds.

**Phishing Method**

For the user that lost $650K, it appears to be a very sophisticated attack. They fell victim as follows...

The malicious attacker requested several password resets against their AppleID/iCloud generating several emails to their account.  From there, they using a spoofed caller id to call the victim and claimed that they were from Apple and calling about suspicious activity on their account.  They asked them to generate their MFA one time pass to confirm that they were the account owner.   The hacker used this to reset the password and take control of the Apple account.  From there, they were able to restore from a backup and drain the wallet of all funds.
