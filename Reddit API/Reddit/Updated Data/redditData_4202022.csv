I'm trying to yolo some cash that I don't have on some PayPal or Meta PUTS to probably lose later on another shit trade that's inevitable to happen. My smooth brained donkey ass is thinking another big drop will happen on either of those two stonks listed above. Does anyone w a slight wrinkle think this plan could go accordingly and if so which one, if not both? I see both Meta and PayPal took a good hit today w put weekly option contracts up about 1000%, give or take, which is juicy enough to wanna yolo tendies I really don't have to make hopefully more tendies I desperately fucking need. Any input would be appreciated, I am literally just taking a stab in the dark but it seems that sometimes those are the best plays.

384,nflx,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,"Thanks NFLX, now I'm just 1k down YTD","Been saying it for a while _ the last 2 years of speculative hype in the market had been driven by indefensible valuations in almost all cases

Feeling more and more like you can look at virtually any stock and their 2019 average and that’s where you Should expect to find the buy price in the next few months 

AAPL 120-150
Amzn 2500
CRM 173.74
PYPL 83.94
Nvda 160.70
AMD 84.25
SHOP 462.70

If NFLX is the harbinger then trace back 3-5 years which Netflix has done with this sell off.  Todays $226 is the Jan 18 high.  

All of this is better than a crash because it is a semi controlled crash 

Be in cash 

Pick your retrace:  2019 or 2018. I don’t think any bounce off a bottom will be solid and most good stocks will fork a channel between hi-lo 2020 prices imo

If you look at a 2-5 year chart you can see it",5.0,u7wzvg,2022-04-20T14:02:58Z,2022-04-20

434,nflx,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,5k to 100k overnight NFLX put,"So what are we looking at, here? You bet that the stock would go down, and when markets opened, that's what happened?

Is it that simple? ""I think this will go down."" -- or is it more like ""I think this will go down by x amount.""

Sorry, wife's bf doesn't let me on the computer much. I'm behind.

Also, congrats and fuck you.

EDIT: Did some research on my own. So basically, yes. If you have a put option and the stock price goes down, you can sell the option for a profit in most cases. Further, put options decrease in value over time since they are losing time value. You *really* gotta call it correctly to make good money. 

TL;DR: If you buy a put option, you want the stock price to go down as quickly as possible. Intrinsic value of the put option decreases over time according to the terms you select.",12.0,u7wtfh,2022-04-20T15:31:44Z,2022-04-20

457,nflx,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,5k to 100k overnight NFLX put,"I'll give you a historical observation from 1987. the day after the crash, the s&p 100 put's went to a screaming volatility. best way to say it was via the trade i did 

9 - 9:30 wondered if I would still have a job the next day, drank lot's of coffee, and said ""everything looks about right ""

after the opening happened and we could start trading ( more delays for some reason and order imbalance ) 

shorted out of the money puts @ 27 to 29 range that was in the morning. 

by lunch they were @ 20

by 3pm they were @ 7

I closed the position and never traded volatility again. 

2 things I learned personally, this won't apply to many people but it applied to me and my character of trading. 

I learned that day, if I have a long position on, and it goes screaming in my favor with a huge volatility, close it, sit back and come into the trade again when it's somewhat normal.

I learned that day, don't go short volatility because I don't have the nerves for it.",2.0,u7wtfh,2022-04-20T17:05:24Z,2022-04-20

460,nflx,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,Seriously NFLX is ran by apes,"Watching Nflx shit the bed is so satisfying. 

Boomers getting paid more money than we will ever see keep making the same awful decision year after year after year.

This will go down as one of the biggest fails by a production studio. Throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks is fine as long as we don’t have to see the failed products. I cannot find titles on Netflix without potentially getting baited into one of the worst movies I’ve ever seen in my entire life. They are doing charity work for awful first time directors.

You idiots had a 10 year head start. You had a great engineering team that made one of the best quality playback engines. But you decided to destroy your reputation by pumping dogshit to fill the hole left by departing titles. They were probably scared shitless that stockholders would panic if they saw total # of films go down, so they decided to become the streaming equivalent a magazine-filled Walmart checkout line instead. 

This news will only serve as a notification for people to cancel their subscription. Next month will be awful for them. Hype it up",30.0,u7s1ye,2022-04-20T09:55:11Z,2022-04-20

They're trying out other pay for services. Maybe they'll go back to Netflix at some point but now they're giving Hulu or AppleTV or Paramount or Disney Plus a shot.  Consumers are also pissed Netflix raised their price. Dumb move if you ask me, put them on the radar for households to be a service to cut. Some would have just continued to keep paying but the publicity from the uptick in price, even if it truly was an inseconsequential amount for most consumers caused faux shock and outrage so for some this was a trigger to cancel. Other consumers for whom money is tight, are using services that help them identify and manage subscriptions they aren't heavily using so that they can more easily cancel them.

* 220 million \* $1 \* 12 months =   + $2.64 billion per year in extra revenue.

Revenue loss from 200,000 subscribers, we'll say at $12.50 on average is:

* 200,000 \* $12.50 \* 12 = $30 million per year

Revenue loss from 2 million subscribers.  At $13 on average is :

Net annual revenue change:

I love that Netflix is seeing consequences for its actions. I hope their stock price plummets and they struggle. Not because I have something against Netflix nor am I outraged by their actions.

I just like to see consumers really making their voices heard. I hope this will lead to cooperations focusing on keeping the public happy rather than trying to suck shareholder dick.

616,nflx,wallstreetbets,POST,Everyone’s going on about NFLX after-hours when $DIS caught a bit of that heat… earnings predictions for $DIS?,"Man oh man what a day for streaming!

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don’t think they’ll have good streaming #’s until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

Disney murdered the Star Wars franchise with their woke nonsense. Netflix can't develop anything interesting because they've knelt to the woke agenda. Twitter, Facebook, all of them will see major collapse.

The woke agenda destroys creativity and humor, it kills storytelling and makes thing less relatable not more.  The entire entertainment industry will continue to collapse because of this.  Will Smith slapping a comedian for telling a joke is a clear sign of just how bad it's getting.  Jesters have always functioned as a check on the powerful, and the powerful are now checking them.

875,nflx,StockMarket,POST,Wait and see: Wall Street ditching Netflix (NFLX.US),"Netflix's ([NFLX.US](https://NFLX.US)) first-quarter 2022 earnings report released after the U.S. stock market on Tuesday was once again surprising, and major Wall Street banks have also lowered their target prices for the stock. U.S. stocks plummeted more than 27% in pre-market trading to $253.03.

According to the financial report, Netflix’s total revenue in the first quarter was $7.87 billion, a year-on-year increase of 9.8%, but lower than the market’s expected $7.93 billion; diluted earnings per share were $3.53, down nearly 6% from $3.75 in the same period last year. , but above analysts' expectations of $2.89.

However, the indicator of global net increase in paying users, which investors are most concerned about, unexpectedly showed negative growth. The loss of 200,000 global paid subscribers in the first quarter was the first negative value since 2011, while Netflix had previously expected an increase of 2.5 million. In addition, Netflix's second-quarter guidance was also disappointing. The company expects to lose 2 million paid users worldwide in the second quarter, compared with the market's forecast of 2.4 million new additions.

By region, subscribers in North America decreased by 640,000, subscribers in EMEA decreased by 300,000, subscribers in Latin America decreased by 350,000, and subscribers in Asia Pacific increased by 1.09 million.

Netflix said in a letter to shareholders that ""revenue growth has slowed significantly"", the entry of traditional media has led to increased competition in the streaming media industry, household penetration has been relatively high, and more than 100 million households worldwide share accounts with others, and inflation is eroding people. The budget allocation for non-essential items such as subscription services, as well as the temporary withdrawal from the Russian market and the closure of user accounts, all adversely affected revenue growth.

After Netflix's really ""ugly"" earnings report was announced, all major Wall Street banks lowered their target prices for the stock. The following are some investment banks' views on the stock:

Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft lowered his price target on Netflix to $300 from $465 and maintained a ""hold"" rating on the stock.

While the first-quarter results fell short of market expectations, Netflix management is making a strategic and tactical shift to focus on ""how best to monetize the phenomenon of different households sharing the same account,"" analysts said, with a rollout that includes Advertising subscription services. Given that Netflix is ​​now ""on the flattened part of the demand curve in most Western markets,"" these measures will be needed to re-accelerate growth. Analysts said Netflix is ​​expected to experience accelerated growth again in the second half of 2023 and in 2024.

Stifel analyst Scott Devitt lowered his price target on Netflix to $300 from $460 and downgraded the stock to ""hold"" from ""buy.""

""All good growth stories come to an end eventually,"" the analyst said. Analysts pointed to Netflix's first-quarter and second-quarter guidance as ""disappointing,"" with the company posting negative user growth in three of its four major regions. Analysts said Netflix still needs to address some longer-term issues, including increased competition, the possibility that its core market has matured and the prevalence of shared accounts, which could be a drag on its growth. Analysts say subscription services that include ads and increased monetization of shared accounts are in the early stages of development and won't be possible until the second half of 2023.

Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion lowered his price target on Netflix to $293 from $562 and downgraded the stock to ""neutral"" from ""overweight.""

Analysts pointed out that Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter, which was significantly lower than the 2.5 million newly expected by the market; the company's management pointed out a series of problems affecting the future growth of subscribers, including the macro environment, shared accounts and increased competition. Analysts said Netflix's user loss will continue into the second quarter, and its revenue growth slowdown may continue into 2023, ""this is a low-growth, low-visibility model, which prompts us to stay on the sidelines.""

Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar lowered his price target on Netflix to $275 from $380 and maintained a ""wait-and-see"" rating on the stock.

Analysts said that even the most pessimistic forecasts did not expect negative user growth in three of Netflix's four main regions, and such negative user growth could occur in the second quarter. Analysts also noted that Netflix itself does not appear to be bullish on near-term profit margin growth, saying it depends on a re-acceleration of revenue growth.

Pivotal Research lowered its price target on Netflix to $235 from $550 and downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from ""buy.""

The analyst said Netflix's first-quarter subscriber numbers and weak second-quarter subscriber guidance were ""shocking,"" and he lowered his forecasts for the company's user growth and earnings. Analysts believe that Netflix's consideration of launching a subscription service that includes advertising but costs less is a negative, ""compared to the current good consumer experience, this move reduces the value of the brand and product."" The analyst noted that in a period of rising interest rates, slumping profitability could make the stock ""unpopular with the investment community.""

In addition, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth downgraded Netflix from ""overweight"" to ""neutral"" with a target price of $300; ​​UBS analyst John Hodulik downgraded Netflix from ""buy"" to ""neutral"" ”, with a target price of $355; Atlantic Equities analyst Hamilton Faber downgraded Netflix from “overweight” to “neutral” with a target price of $280.",3.0,u7va6o,2022-04-20T12:23:51Z,2022-04-20

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

In my non qualified, non professional opinion and story, I subscribe to at least 5 different streaming services. They include Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, Apple TV+, and Paramount+. Netflix is the only one up on the chopping block because it’s more expensive than the others, is too inconsistent with their content, and with the password crackdown I soon won’t be able to share with family.

From an average consumer perspective in America, why would I not cancel it and either: A) Subscribe when a big show comes out then cancel immediately, or B) Pirate all of their shit

They peaked about 4-5 years ago and now they’re reaping what they’ve sown. Plus, if we’re speaking about emotional reactions, how about their reaction to all of this? “We’re going to scale back content, the main reason people subscribe in the first place.”

1016,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Anyone else think -29% on NFLX is a bit overdone?!?,"I think its overdone.

plan flexibility is a good idea. its part of the reason why the other platforms have (sort of) caught up. the sharing password thing is a no-duh from a corp/investor point of view. I get why customers disagree, but combining with plan flexibility they could easily lower prices for single/double streams and offer their high tier plan as a multi-stream.

im a little concerned about running down the creative budget and I agree with the criticisms that they shut down series too soon. imo Netflix should be a place where obscure series thrive. granted, there is always a cost, but it should strive to maintain that rep rather then a rep of shutting shows down.

internationally, I think Netflix beats all. I personally hate when I see a show that looks awesome, only to learn its in Polish, but most of the world is used to watching American movies with subtitles. which means that awesome polish show has more appeal worldwide than it does to people like me. 

I like HBO, but it isn't the end-all. overall the quality is better, but the selection isn't as vast. I see this as a positive (for HBO) in some ways, but bottom line is that it doesnt really replace Netflix. paramount/peacock/apple are small time. I do the $5 subs because they are almost free (see above). I dont watch Hulu, so I cant comment on it, but I never hear about any really good content on Hulu (other than Handmaids Tale). if there was, it would draw me to it. Prime is... I dont know. it has some good series, but otherwise just seems like a non-player. 

it sucks seeing it drop like this. I am worried. but ive withstood drops before and will again. nothing has really changed for me on Netflix except that it will take a while to grow confidence of many. hopefully this signals to the board that they need to get in gear because its a new landscape. plan flexibility is a big start to that and its not a negative for investor or customer.",1.0,u7w8nr,2022-04-20T14:06:58Z,2022-04-20

The earning call indicates that management doesn't know when Netflix will resume its growth. In fact, it projected that another shrinkage of 2M subscribers is coming in the next quarter. 

The next challenge for Netflix is to go from focusing on subscriber growth to squeezing more dollars out of its existing base. To know if Netflix can do this or not will take expertise way beyond mine. What is clear is that you cannot just take the recent 30% fall as a reason to buy.

1062,nflx,stocks,POST,Everyone’s going on about NFLX after-hours when $DIS caught a bit of that heat… earnings predictions for $DIS?,"Man oh man what a day for streaming!

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don’t think they’ll have good streaming #’s until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

1115,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,NFLX - still too expensive at $260?,"Disney makes a lot of money licensing it’s show s to broadcasters. 

Netflix has plenty of older originals and even reality that they could sell for air rights and even syndicated.
And still not be competing against themselves.

But Netflix  sure likes doing just one thing.

And their originals are hit or misses. SAme as Disney. The difference is that Disney can recoup via selling it to broadcasters around the world, be added to theme park, merch etc while still helping them sell more subscribers.

Another important factor is that these competing studios will not be giving Netflix their good shows or any newer shows at all.

1280,nflx,stocks,COMMENT,Thoughts on Netflix ($NFLX) Earnings today after hours?,"Netflix's problems are its problems alone, and I have been predicting this for a year or two. first they have no real library and can no longer easily license from studios. Second they have never really operated on free cashflow but on borrowing, so they are cash poor.  Third, their huge global reach is largely based on poor'ish people sharing access codes, so one paying sub delivers Netflix to 20-30 people.  My condo in Mexico recently cut off Netflix service because Netflix was forcing them to buy a different sub for ever unit when previously one sub took care of 40 units.  My Colombian girlfriend long watched Netflix on borrowed or stolen codes, that is how they all do it down here in Latin America.

So, Netflix may have to overhaul itself, but how?  Now WBD and Disney both have better product and PARA, Apple and Amazon are about equal.  Maybe Netflix can buy Columbia or give Sony hgakf its stock in excghange for Columbia, since Netflix has no cash. But I would not wnt to try to figure that one out now.  The best service now is HBO-Discovery. And that and PARA are also the two stocks to buy, in fact buy them today with the 6% discount caused by the company thei are taking market share from, Netflix,",0.0,u7a3t0,2022-04-20T11:55:52Z,2022-04-20

EDIT: lmao, it's been 4 minutes and already down to 33% upvote rate.

EDIT2: 5 minutes and back to 67% (thanks for the couple of upvotes, night-apes!)

EDIT3: 10 minutes in, up to 78%... did they only have one account online to spam new for downvotes? Or are they still looking up the login info for their alt-accounts? 😜 If so, they're running on minimal manpower - having some financial issues up there in the penthouse?

EDIT4: 13 minutes, and here they come! Back down to 70% - give that underpaid intern a raise! They'll need those savings, soon 😉

EDIT5: 18 minutes, 7 upvotes, 77% upvote rate. I think we've hit the jackpot on the one-armed bandits! 🎰

EDIT 6: 23 minutes after post - 9 up, 80% upvote rate. Who else waiting for die Diamantenhänders? 💎🙌

EDIT7: 27 minutes - 9 up, 76% - speaking of which, whatever happened to the original Diamantenhände ape, u/dergurkenraspler ? Props to u/parsnip for taking up the torch, but does anyone know what happened?

EDIT8: 33 minutes in, 14 up, 82% upvote rate. Looks like another 600 online since posting. Guten morgen, apes!

EDIT9: 38 minutes - 18 up, 85% upvote. 1885... brb, gonna grab a whiskey (join me with a tall, cold glass of water, sober apes!)

EDIT10: 42 minutes, 19 up, 85%. 1985! I'M BACK... IN THE FUTURE!

EDIT11: 46min, 23, 87%. Report: in the year 2387, the apes still thrive...

EDIT12: 51min, 24 up, 87% down, and it's 4/20 somewhere! 🥳🎉

EDIT13: 1 Hour, 30 up, 85% upvote ratio. Gonna take a quick break (time zones, apes). I'll be checking in and updating regularly, though.

EDIT14: THANKS TO u/CollapsingUniverse for this update request! 1 Hour, 17 minutes - 34 up, 84% upvote ratio!

EDIT 15: 1 Hour, 35 min. - 42 up, 87% upvote rate. Check out the high-quality GME memes on u/onethreetombo's profile! Seriously, when did the effort fall out of GME memes? APES used to produce full SONGS, even - it's what really kicked it all off for the wider public!  


EDIT 16: 1 Hour, 46 min. - 45 up, 88% upvote rate. If I fall asleep during my break from reddit, I'll see you all in the morning! ...probably around noon or so, market time 😜",1.0,u7osbz,2022-04-20T05:05:04Z,2022-04-20

I think bulls are celebrating too early. If tesla call doesn't end well, which it can, then calls are fuckt. And  if tesla doesn't want to have a very, very bad Q2, they might want to be honest about all the bad news and address it right now.

If he gets distracted on the earnings call with rambling about robots, twitter, selling TSLA to acquire netflix to de-wokify them, or a hundred other that's-so-Elon scenarios then it could be a dip for a few weeks.

1552,tsla,wallstreetbets,POST,"True believer in Elon and TSLA even now. Here’s what I know, and my question: how do I best yolo so my kids can have little Tesla ATVs","Tesla is sitting over $1,000 today after bouncing back (again) from around $800. Our favorite fund manager, Cathie Wood, and the team at ARK smoke the $4,600 a share hopium as soon as they wake up in the morning. If they’re right (and they always, always are) then we’re looking at 450% return on the stock over the next several years. That’s great, but I don’t have the dry powder to buy enough stock to change lives. 

Here are my reasons why I really, truly do believe this company is going even higher: and they aren’t what you expect. 

1: I genuinely feel for Elon as a human being. If you care to watch him closely in moments of contemplation, he isn’t all 420 jokes and dog memes. This is a man who is badly scarred from childhood, still struggling to fix the world around him like he could never do for himself. This is the type of deep, foundational pain that most people don’t understand but, for those of us who do, explains so much about how driven to obsessive he is. This is a man who is going to literally change the course of human history because he can’t change his own. 

2: Tesla isn’t a car company. The things that excite me about the next 3-5 years have nothing to do with that sexy, sexy S Plaid. I’m talking robots. I’m talking battery technology, capacity, and vertical integration. I’m talking about AI that goes beyond autonomous vehicles. I’m talking about Optimus. Come on! The name is literally Optimus!

3: Scale. Elon is all about scale. More, faster, better, and cheaper as they grow. Even while raw materials shoot through the roof, they’re acquiring the whole chain. They’re making everything they can in house or own the suppliers. That type of scalability is literally unheard. 

So I’m in. I’m all in. I’m going to sell my crap stocks like <insert everything> and buy up whatever I can. 

However, I just bought a home and my kid is about to go to a stupidly, ridiculously expensive college. I foolishly sold 35 shares to help buy shelter so I’m down to just 15. Picking up a few shares now and then when it dips isn’t going to cut it for me. So this has got to be some crazy option play. Exactly what that play is though is TBD.

Positions: 15 shares, no options yet, but a legit, in the wild, true believer.",20.0,u7mn07,2022-04-20T02:59:18Z,2022-04-20

1895,gme,wallstreetbets,COMMENT,GME and AMC,"Both are dinosaurs and novelties of a past era. Their cultural relevance was little to none before the 'short squeeze' of 2021 happened.

If you'll remember, GME's market cap went *lower* than its book value, which is its real assets such as real estate, inventory, etc. That's weird, but not uncommon when companies are tumbling down. It's an indication that people who were trying to make a buck off its downfall, got greedy and pushed the price way below what the market considered fair.

That's ultimately how we're in the situation today. Of course, GME brought in new leadership and are rapidly trying to adapt its business. Hard to gauge their potential given the competitors in all the spaces GME is trying to grow, but anyway.",8.0,u7y65j,2022-04-20T15:09:49Z,2022-04-20

http://www.gmedd.com delves into the prospects for the company pretty deep too.

As for AMC?

Why is someone unwilling to show their positions telling GME investors what to do?,"What even is a ""call to action"". In my opinion all opinion journalism, almost all political conversations, and everything my boss says is a ""call to action"". In the grand scheme of things it means nothing.  
In fact a decent argument could be made that these sort of things have the opposite of the intended effect. Either people think it's a huge enough deal that everyone else will handle it, or just go with a hard eye roll because someone is telling them what to do.  
I get up in the morning because my country requires me to have money to exist in a non-homeless form, that's basically it.  
I personally haven't even posted my DRS numbers to the bot, and I've been buying through CS for months now. I clicked that petition to ban PFOF or w/e it was, but haven't bothered ""writing to my reps"". People telling me to do something, ON REDDIT no less, like for fucks sake mate.

But I also really feel like I have an excellent handle on the mechanics at play here, and the ability to explain it all succinctly. Still, at this point, I’m not telling anyone else. It would take too long and be too complicated for most casual conversations, and the narrative is fixed in a lot of people’s minds. Plus — and most importantly — no amount of explaining will convince people the theory is right the way that the price spiking will. I don’t understand why so many people on here seem so desperate for their golfing buddy / skeptical parent / partner / boss to believe in and support what they’re doing, there’s this huge drive for validation from some apes — from the MSM and everyone else.

2723,gme,GME,COMMENT,Smooth brain doesn't maff gud. Buy more GME now or wait for the split?,"Let’s assume that the share split dividend is a 7 to 1 split. So for every share you own before the dividend date, you’ll receive 6 more. So if the share price stays the same from now until the dividend, then you’re getting the same exact amount of shares for your money if you buy now or after.

So if you wait till after the split-dividend, yes you’re technically buying more shares, but you’re still getting the same bang for your buck by buying before the dividend (assuming price stays the same).

I’m a firm believer that the stock split-dividend will raise the cost per share by causing a wave of retail buying due to the more affordable price. I also believe that the stock split-dividend will be the catalyst for MOASS.

This is not financial advice. Do whatever you want with your money, my only hope is that you make an informed decision.

2916,gme,Superstonk,POST,New rules to “stop MOASS” won’t work because the rules already created and in place to stop illegal short selling haven’t work and there’s already the plan to take GME out of the corrupt system (which would trigger MOASS),"The rules that have been put in place after the Sneeze and the rules meant to stop illegal short selling from occurring in the first place have all been ignored and ultimately for nothing.

And why would creating new rules within a corrupt system work to stop the MOASS when there’s already a likely plan to take GameStop out of the corrupt system in the first place; forcing shorts to close their short positions whether they like it or not?

We have had plenty of phases where people “discovered” rules that would end MOASS; “bail-ins”, forever FTD’s and trading halts, ComputerShare limit sells at $200K, etc.

All have ended the same. People thought about them, realized they were faulty arguments when the finer details were left out by the people(s) who brought them forward and when considered made their arguments invalid, and we all moved on.

The thing about manipulators is that they will always use the exact same tactics to manipulate their victims; it’s just what’s on the surface that changes. 

This is no different.

Just another scare tactic to get us divided under a different mask.",72.0,u87nko,2022-04-20T21:58:08Z,2022-04-20

So it’s not like a cash dividend, but an issuance of new shares, calculated at whatever ratio to your current share ownership.  You’re not getting something extra, you’re getting more shares and a lower shareprice, issued as a dividend.

Always look out for  “casual” comments that add absolutely nothing to the conversation but exist solely to boost visibility “I agree!” Or “great post!” Or “I’m with OP”

3003,gme,Superstonk,COMMENT,All users with year old accounts and words like “stonk” “ape” “GME” or any lingo in the username should be highly scrutinized.,">More than half of every account I inspect is around a year old.

That's definately around the time when a bunch of people jumped on after they were pumped up about how nontraditional investors/DFV mooned GME.  It would make sense to see a bunch of 15-9 month old accounts.  I say 9 because for some people it took a while and GME was shown to not be a late Jan everyone held backs story like the MSM pushed. 

The resurgence in early march brought killed that notion to sensible people very quick - Feb 19 to March 12th had a straight climb up from 40s - only that time it didnt liquidate off and held a floor of about 156 only to go up to  248 in early june and slightly lower climb in Nov.  Looking at the steady late feb-early march buildup I can imagine a lot of people were piling in , and making their accounts in this period,  which would be about a year - I would guess even more than the initial climb in Jan.  

There's definately some suspicious ones ive seen in replies - and im certain a lot of people have bots for the reason your talking about - some probably to just spam people to try to grow their business or whatever, ive definately gotten a slew of DMs with names like you specified  HODLAPE and shit like that.  But i would think an account that is 1 year old (probably 13-14 months) is unusual given the steady build of loyal investors in that march climb.  I was really crazy about everything in that time bc ever day it was up more and more - I had like genuine pride and excitement bc of what it symbolized to.  I got on in february and before that I put money in ETFs every quarterly bonus and rarely paid attention to what was going on.  

February-march-april were three months that definately changed most of what I do and since then its stuck,  felt a little bit of that a month ago which only strengthened my resolve.  But those months in 2021 definately brought a lot of new retail investors to the table, and the infiltrators/manipulators with them.  It would be hard to use the date range of around a year as a red flag given that both types of users grew at the same time.",3.0,u84ror,2022-04-20T20:14:15Z,2022-04-20

3272,gme,Superstonk,POST,If you are a HF and are naked short on GME at a ratio of say 11:1 and then a vote for a 7:1 stock split dividend is announced do you now need to buy 7x11=77 calls for every FTD you are hiding to kick the can?,"I'm a smooth, so forgive me.

I mean, it's one thing if you are short 1:1 and just need to buy 7 to sell (edit, give actually) to someone who needs to hand out a dividend.  But if you are naked short, can't locate shares, and need to just make some imaginary ones, you gotta buy the 77 calls to pretend you will acquire them right?

So every FTD = 77 calls for this HF in this example?",57.0,u7v8wa,2022-04-20T12:21:48Z,2022-04-20

***What's This Post All About?***

The first thing you'll notice is a stickied comment right at the top. We call this the ""Front Desk"". Every day a moderator will create a new sticky comment that includes links to community announcements, fantastic posts that deserve more attention, and generally the simplest and easiest way to interact with the moderators of this community. The rest of the post is designed for general discussion and content/questions that might not need their own post.

If you are new please mention that when you comment. There are no stupid questions but ""shills"" (paid accounts with the intent to disrupt the sub) are real. This community sees a lot of trolls. If you do not distinguish yourself as someone with genuine questions it is likely that members of our community will assume you are just spreading ""FUD"" (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). I hate that I have to give you this warning but it is just the nature of the beast at this point.

Please have fun, play nice and be civil. Many of our rules are heavily enforced. Debate is welcome but if it devolves into personal insults please report the comment. *Ape no fight ape!*",2270.0,u7qj81,2022-04-20T07:00:10Z,2022-04-20

TLDR: GME dividend split is similar to Tesla who did the same type of split. Tesla was  reported 7.10% SI to float and a 0.30% borrowing fee. GameStop's reported SI and borrowing fees are  reported short interest is at 22.21%. Cost to borrow 8.72%.  
but don't forget shorts never covered, the SEC said so, and Jan 2021 it was what, 221% short?   Hedges are fukt

Good doc about the flash crash where over a trillion was lost in market caps in about 10 min.

A guy got sick of algos beating him on trades and created his own. It worked so well that other algos were taking his into consideration when creating their output. Then he turned his off one day for w/e reason and the output from their algos turned into sell sell sell.

Shows you how algo trading/hft is one giant interdependent organism.

To Whom It May Concern,


As a citizen of the United States of America and as a retail investor, it is my understanding that it is the job of the SEC to protect investors, and maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets. 

Today I am writing about SR-NSCC-2022-003 and to express my opposition towards it. This bill completely favors large institutional investors at the cost of retail. The current market is already rife with abusive naked short selling, PFOF, FTD manipulation through derivatives and dark pool order routing for retail order flow. All of which prevents accurate price discovery.  This proposed rule change would allow institutional players more freedoms to continue with these malicious practices. This benefits the big players at the cost of the retail investor.

My faith in the free and efficient markets of the United States and in the SEC will be forever damaged if the SEC turns a blind eye to the plight of retail investors in favor of the institutions and their lobbyists. 

As someone who has served (and continues to serve) this country in the armed forces I implore you to now serve the people of this country and do your job and protect retail investors. Show us that the free market is not just an illusion.

3819,gme,Superstonk,POST,Round 2... FIGHT!! (Correlation between GME Price Action + SEC proposals + Ryan Cohen tweets),"\*\*TLDR:\*\*My original hypothesis ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u58o6s/new_proposed_rule_13f2_comment_closes_april_26/)) was that major key players that is shorting GME are scared of SEC filings/comments due to being at risk on their plays.  I truly believe that they are using drops and runs as a means of distraction.  My new hypothesis:  Major key players shorting GME are utilizing the share price action as a means to distraction; in which, Ryan Cohen is informing us of important filings through his tweets.

\*\*Update:\*\*Please read my recent post ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/u58o6s/new_proposed_rule_13f2_comment_closes_april_26/)).  Overall in that post, I basically find correlation that specific SEC filings/comment will ramp and/or dramatically drop as a possible means of distraction.  I provide dates of SEC proposals compared to beginning dates of the start of a dramatic run or decline.  I am providing an update primarily because when I saw Cohen's tweet this morning including a SEC proposal (a very important one: ~~Short Position and Short Activity Reporting by Institutional Investment Managers~~  ***Securities Finance Transactions \[Edit 4/20/22 11:12am pacific\])***, I predicted that we would either have a very dramatic drop or ramping up-tick in GME.   My prediction was correct.  I do find correlation between Ryan Cohen's tweet, SEC proposals, and GME share price.   ***My new hypothesis:***  Major key players shorting GME are utilizing the share price action as a means to distraction; in which, Ryan Cohen is informing us of important filings through his tweets.

&#x200B;

**March 2nd was a decline up until March 15th (evidence in my previous post).   Starting from March 16th, a SEC proposal was announced.  I looked back and found that Ryan Cohen tweeted on March 2nd intraday and March 14th+15th.  Below are screenshots.**

[March 2, March 14th, and March 15th tweets from RC.](https://preview.redd.it/ybbntsqgulu81.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e684620f4d0c17ecf5e237d31b56c8c87817b58)

&#x200B;

**Then on April 18th, Ryan Cohen tweets where the following morning, the SEC releases a very important proposal on April 19th:  Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)**

**Limitations:**  Again, if you read my previous post, you are very well aware of my listed limitations so I will be adding on.  Overall, I need more data sets to strengthen my research.  Moving forward, I will be collecting Ryan Cohen's tweets and cross-referencing with any released SEC filings, proposals, and/or notices in regards to any of the regulatory organizations.  I do not have much time to pull past Federal Register and sift through it because I work Full-Time + OT as it would take too much of my time to do so and I need my sleep.  If anyone wants to help, please do so if you have free time. You can reach out to me by DM.  If not, I'll just keep moving forward.  Another limitation is that I am unsure what Ryan Cohen is trying to tell us.

**Conclusion:**  I do find correlation between GME's aggressive up-tick/down-tick in regards to SEC's proposals, filings, and/or notices.  If anything, Ryan Cohen's tweet has strengthened my findings in regards to evidence of cross-referencing dates.   Remember, please comment on the 240.13F-2 (Proposed Rule 13F-2 Short Selling Transparency) as well.  I get it that people want to focus on the NSCC SFT, but these two are important as a whole.

**EDIT 1 04/19/22 10:50pm pacific:**

Here are additional correlation comparisons for yall on Feb 8-9 and Feb 24-25 with Ryan Cohen's tweet.  This one will be confusing but they all circulate around the same time.  The weird part is: the dates are all mixed and the published documents were not being updated properly as they should be such as on the Federal Register or Proposal Commenting Page.  Even the dates are all skewed.  For example, Shortening the Securities Transactions Settlement Cycle was released on Feb 9th but posted on Federal Register on Feb 24th (weird huh?).  Guess what? Both dates ran.  However, those dates within that same week had VERY important filings:  Short selling transparency, shortening settlement cycle, and reporting of SECURITIES LOANS (sound familiar?).   Again, this strengthens my hypothesis.

**Edit 2 4/19/22 11:25pm:**

My response to another redditor:  I should also note that their filings that has to do with mitigating risk began late last year to present moment. I truly believe that they thought they could shake off retail last year, failed, and now realized how truly fucked they are.

Check this: [https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/proposedarchive/proposed2021.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/proposedarchive/proposed2021.shtml)

If you look in 2021, starting from around November, they started to take their filings seriously. If you look back at 2020, there is literally NOTHING that has to do with market risks.  Now look at 2022 1st quarter... massive filings.  Is this a coincidence?  I am not sure.  Again, I could be VERY VERY VERY wrong.  Please take it with a grain of salt as this is just a working theory.  I do not want to mislead anyone.",606.0,u7o0ik,2022-04-20T04:14:58Z,2022-04-20

Even before Elon I called bs which is why I held and bought more.  When the sec report came saying it wasn't covering that was confirmation for me.  Elon is the nail in the coffin, what would the man care currently hes like a multi billionaire, possibly soon to be trillionaire, with tons of important things to do than go on a show and say things that weren't true and not important.

They probably figured out how to manipulate short interest already during the Tesla run.  If they could do it to Tesla why not gme?

Serious props.  

I read this post intently.  I've been on the share dividend ever since last year.   I got put down due to shills (most def) and fog-of-war over what kind of dividend might smash shorts - cash, share or NFT.   NFT got ejaculated into sub and has stuck around right the Great Crypto Pump of last summer until recently.   All is fair, bigons.   I didn't (and probably still don't) completely understand how a share dividend works best, but my gut has always been that it is, and because it works with all the established precedent and existing rules very well.   

Anyways, the fuckey with Tesla and the beginning of weaponized autism on the OG sub showed me that the curtain was being pulled back and I started to understand better and started saving to try my luck at the casino for myself.  

Point is, thanks.   


This was really, really well written and something I wanted to explore on my own, using Tesla as an analogue.   Truth be told, I was having a hard time trying to figure out where to start with it.  

You laid it all out well, confirms my bias (hah), and presented it simply.   Also, you give people like me a way to see where to start in getting the right information to do their own dirty work.  

I still think there are a few curve balls with all the rule changes that have happened over the year, but I think this is the general direction. 

People like you make this sub great.  Thanks.",2.0,u7blcg,2022-04-20T07:01:18Z,2022-04-20

A look at Tesla's stock split as a comparable for GameStop.,"Excellent work, so very well articulated, I understood **new** things from the Tesla charts I had seen at least 5 times before.

Top work OP.

Please keep addressing these lingering uncertainties as new info emerges.

Regarding 'poofing' more shares into existence, AFAIK, all the methods they use to naked short involve *someone, somewhere* being on the other end of a *transaction*. They may be able to mark shares as ""sold not yet purchased"" but I don't think they have a column in the accounts for ""printed from thin air because whatever"".

Distributing shares in the form of a dividend is not a *transaction*, we are not buying them, they are not selling them, all that is **supposed** to be happening is a game of pass the parcel.

Any such magic creation of new shares by the DTCC or Brokers or MMs would need to eventually appear on some set of books as some sort of *liability*, unless we have finally *actually* moved into a completely fraudulent system.",1.0,u7blcg,2022-04-20T00:04:40Z,2022-04-20

There were innumerable things happening with Tesla… what are you going to do, go back and look at how much actual positivity there was around Tesla at the time it started and continued squeezing?

You can’t just say oh yeah the split definitely caused Tesla to squeeze unless you’re too stupid to think critically which is to say you analyze all potential variables.

8543,spy,wallstreetbets,POST,"4-20-22 SPY, Apple, QQQ Daily TA (with p/l screenshots)"," Day three of essentially sideways range trading clocked in for the week. This is the most sideways I have seen the market day after day in a while. I think the market is a little on edge to say the least right now with earnings approaching and especially with the anticipation of Tesla earnings which are live now. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d9jcxe2qrru81.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e46d1b878ed7ac9e3693703a6864a7f42d71e9b

Tesla essentially killed it with earnings! I didn’t get to listen to the conference call but I hear they are thinking of a self driving vehicle subscription. Otherwise I didn’t hear any note worthy conference call news. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nfoxfqhqrru81.png?width=444&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2f6e5f2b3063efc84beebaabba1815f419f573c

Being that its up 4.58% currently after market I don’t think there was anything scary either. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xn0p7v3rrru81.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca411c95330d8382a61ed18307b26b86f7cf10c8

The key takeaways today for SPY were that 1. 447.2 is a MAJOR resistance that is going to take some time to get through and 2. 444 is a hella strong support that is also going to be tough to get through with 445 being noteworthy too. SPY continues to enjoy this sideways trading and to be honest I do too. I killed it today scalping these run ups and downs today. Ill take a day like this every single day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5kcyixqrrru81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bcd3a6e79654926bee5239502a0c3aa2b0a4bca

Despite SPYs ability to do it today it FAILED to break the bear channel. This bear channel is utilizing the two most recent “highs” from March 29th and April 5th. That lower highs trend is still yet to be broken. Resistance will be at 447 tomorrow which is quite a peculiar resistance line with how strong that rejected us numerous times today. Support remains near 430 tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/emlrltasrru81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb6ea2d7b5f62df28957b6771df45064cffd7a76

Despite the bears managing to close SPY red today at 0.07% the bulls made headway today. The bulls were able to break above the daily 100 ema at 446 today. However, they failed to close above it and settled for a close above the daily 8, 20, and 50ema which sit at 444. 27/ 444.38 and 443.31. Overall despite the sideways burning day SPY did have bullish momentum. Tomorrow if bulls can break this above 448 we will see the daily bear channel broken and I do believe riding off of Teslas great earnings we could see a rip to 460 next week or end of month. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/toot0xxsrru81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7eee45e2b8e45595f63a57cc96355980d9f5268c

Apple enjoyed a sideways day too, however, struggled quite a bit more then SPY did today overall. We saw Apple reject the upward resistance line which is also its daily 20ema at 168.95 today. However, apple bulls are stacking candles on top of eachother now and I do suspect we will see this bear channel broke, especially with good news from the tesla earnings.  Apple closing above its daily 8ema is a bullish momentum move also. I fully expect apple to be able to have a green bull day near 170.5. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/581ngydtrru81.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=53f74353eee707af03bd2132886d610bf4787042

QQQ continues to stack candles higher also and appears to be establishing some bullish momentum. As I have mentioned before have suspect that the 338 level was the “bottom” for now. I fully expect to see 370-375 end of month without any bad news catalysts. QQQ while breaking the daily 8ema and touching the daily 20ema failed to close above either today. QQQ bulls will need to take this opportunity to close above those key resistance lines tomorrow in order to see a bull week next week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bwti2x3urru81.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=c49d241a243c16e8ccac992159b88c3d31da33d4

The VIX enjoyed nothing but sideways trading all day today sticking to a tight $2.50 range almost all day. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aonzikkurru81.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ebb40b0e7e49d05255c0134a8f2bb55cb44fc50

The VIX is now trading within its recent “mean” with its recent range being 18.5 to 24.8. This lower vix is not only going to cause less volatility and smaller swings/ daily moves but its going to result in some more of these sideways boring days. With the VIX close to 18.5 then it has been since April 5th I will look for the bulls to take this as an opportunity to get this back to 450+. 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a hella good day on the server. I made/ called out 11 trades today and 10 of which were profitable (one did close at 0% but it was not red and I count that as a win). Here is my daily trade log

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 13%

4/20/2022 Call 2dte 24%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 10%

4/20/2022 Put 5dte -10%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 25%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 60%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 50%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (apple) 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 18%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 8%

This is I believe one of if not the most trades I have made in a single day of trading yet and with a 90.9% win rate on the day. I did throw two 0dte in there today but sticking to no 0 dte and a smaller position size of 2500/ trade has made a massive difference this week. I also had some people I feel “skeptical” of my actual trades and my log so today you will get a screenshot of my TOS. 

Today as you can see I actually played two Tesla “Lottos” I had planned these to be overnight puts for earnings but I was able to close one at 50% and one at 18% which pretty much allowed me to play the current 4/22 855P I have open for free. Obviously unless sentiment changes over night those are going to take quite a massive hit at open but with a big enough IV pump ill be content with a 50% loss on it. But it is what it is and was a true one contract LOTTO paid for by my daily tesla put profits. 

Hyperwheel I was able to sell 3 puts and close at 50% profits for an additional $203.64 in premium today. I currently have 3 puts open sitting at 30% profit I suspect I will roll tomorrow. 

hyperwheel return is 4.04% 

buy and hold is 2.06%

Expect a bloodbath. Users are leaving FB in droves, which will effect their business model greatly since at the end of the day they’re just selling ad space on their platform. Less users = less ad revenue = reduced profits.

9092,fb,stocks,POST,"NFLX plummeted 35%, and its teammates, who were as stupid as pigs, dragged down FB, DIS, ROKU, and AMZN by themselves.","NFLX suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, sending its shares plunging 25% in extended trading amid fears that the groundbreaking streaming service may have had its best days.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Do you think this is logical?

Instead, the winners in the market today are bank stocks like GS, WFC, MS, etc.

If you'll remember, GME's market cap went *lower* than its book value, which is its real assets such as real estate, inventory, etc. That's weird, but not uncommon when companies are tumbling down. It's an indication that people who were trying to make a buck off its downfall, got greedy and pushed the price way below what the market considered fair.

That's ultimately how we're in the situation today. Of course, GME brought in new leadership and are rapidly trying to adapt its business. Hard to gauge their potential given the competitors in all the spaces GME is trying to grow, but anyway.",8.0,u7y65j,2022-04-20T15:09:49Z,2022-04-20

http://www.gmedd.com delves into the prospects for the company pretty deep too.

As for AMC?

9375,dis,wallstreetbets,POST,Everyone’s going on about NFLX after-hours when $DIS caught a bit of that heat… earnings predictions for $DIS?,"Man oh man what a day for streaming!

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don’t think they’ll have good streaming #’s until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

Disney murdered the Star Wars franchise with their woke nonsense. Netflix can't develop anything interesting because they've knelt to the woke agenda. Twitter, Facebook, all of them will see major collapse.

The woke agenda destroys creativity and humor, it kills storytelling and makes thing less relatable not more.  The entire entertainment industry will continue to collapse because of this.  Will Smith slapping a comedian for telling a joke is a clear sign of just how bad it's getting.  Jesters have always functioned as a check on the powerful, and the powerful are now checking them.

9391,dis,stocks,POST,"NFLX plummeted 35%, and its teammates, who were as stupid as pigs, dragged down FB, DIS, ROKU, and AMZN by themselves.","NFLX suffered its first subscriber loss in more than a decade, sending its shares plunging 25% in extended trading amid fears that the groundbreaking streaming service may have had its best days.

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Do you think this is logical?

Instead, the winners in the market today are bank stocks like GS, WFC, MS, etc.

Besides what happened to Netflix, has anyone noticed what happened to Disney today? It was a beautiful day of rebounding until AH took away all gains and then some. I understand that sentiment has gone down for Disney due to their involvement with the Dont Say Gay Bill, however, once news dropped that the Governor of Florida was going to start cracking down on Disneys business in Florida, the stock still saw gains.

Why do you guys think Disney followed Netflix during after hours? Do you guys think Disney will have a similar earnings outcome? 

Personally, I don’t think they’ll have good streaming #’s until next report once the subscribers for Kenobi start rolling in.

And we're now setting up for possibly/likely Disney's best park season ever.  Everything is going to be up - attendance, prices, total spend.

But with all that being said - knee jerk reaction on any streaming bad news could also pull down (or hold back) the entire stock.  

But in my opinion that's just a better buying price for those willing to hold another quarter.

I think parks will be way up but streaming could come under expectationa due to the recent political stories. Also, regarding inflation, Disney+ is probably a service that will be cut before Netflix.

9513,nvda,stocks,POST,Thoughts on putting 5k into market 90% vti/schd & rest in Roku and NVDA?,"Hi I suck at stocks and investing. I started during the initial gme bubble and moves into boring stocks and I'm still down 6% 90% of my portfolio is vgt and vti with more vti than vgt. Rest is soxx, tiny bit in Netflix (woo..) and NVDA. Funny enough NVDA I've jumped in and out since early last year and somehow only stock I've done decent on.

Anyway I'm 30 and have only a couple gs in the market but want to continue to try to create some money as job wages are flat/going down with inflation and me ever making good money is unlikely. I save all my money and that seems to be hurting me.

Thinking of putting another $5000 into mostly save stuff vti and schd to have a safe investment and some slow building dividends. I noticed Roku is dipped a lot which surprises me as they seem to be a healthy company and actually look to have an upside with being on everything, investment in a Roku channel to get more direct as rev from tv and shows and are even looking to make original shows. They are ad supported but with inflation and people trying to save money I can see people using them more instead of premium streaming services. Thoughts on putting $200 in them? And then there is NVDA, seems like it will continue going up bad idea, also seems healthy. We always need processors.",2.0,u82lcp,2022-04-20T18:06:15Z,2022-04-20

Roku has generally sold devices at a loss or break-even to get more people on the service - the real core business is advertising. With supply chain issues, costs more and more to make a device.

IMO, you're going to see consolidation in services. Roku won the day not that long ago because it was the ""neutral party"" that had all the apps and that's all they had to do. Now you're looking at what seems an awful lot like oversaturation of streaming apps and will probably be more and more deals like WB/Discovery and with larger customers there may be more fights a la Roku vs Google last year.

Roku going more and more into original programming - now you're getting into something else entirely. The thesis not that long ago was fairly simple/straightforward. 

More and more people going out.

I like ROKU better than NFLX and ROKU is so obliterated at this point that a bounce wouldn't be surprising, but it's not the same thesis as when I owned it in 2019/2020 and therefore not really interested in it as a long-term holding anymore.",2.0,u82lcp,2022-04-20T18:42:12Z,2022-04-20

FB was down 6.5%, DIS was down 5%, ROKU was down 6%, AMZN was down 2%, and the Nasdaq was down 1%.

To be honest, I didn't expect the NFLX to have such a big impact that it would cause the Nasdaq to fall along with stocks like FB DIS. I guess everyone is like me and definitely didn't expect NFLX to have so much influence.

Then they posted their first profit ever and rocketed 58% the next day once everyone realized Snap was not only unrelated to FB's sinking ship, but is taking their lost market share.

What's happening today? NFLX tanked again and the sky is falling, so everything growth is down bigly today on no news.

Now lets get to why Snap could rocket. Traffic is way up from last quarter across the board, but more importantly, **desktop** traffic is up by 11m last quarter. You may be wondering, who the hell uses Snapchat on desktop? Advertisers, that's who. If you have to generate creative, upload files, view reports, download lead files, retrieve invoices to submit to accounting etc - it's gotta be on desktop.

Marketing types are scrambling to find replacements for the eyes they are losing on Facebook. My guess is lots of new advertiser accounts created right after the FB fiasco.

EPS last time around was 0.01, a huge improvement. Avg estimate now is 0.01 which means a big beat is feasible, combined with the NFXL drop we might see a nice move.

Positions:  
10x 4/22 43/48 Bull Call Spread   
5x 4/22 -29p/34c Risk Reversal (if I'm wrong I'll take assignment and sell CC's in between shifts at Wendy's)  


TLDR: I bought calls, you should buy puts.

10034,vix,wallstreetbets,POST,The rogue VIX spike that leaked out today to spark that morning sell-off has happened three other times since Corona on green market days. In all three other instances the spike has been followed by a 20% volatility increase within two trading days afterwards.,"I started to notice a pattern related to the rogue VIX spikes that will appear completely out of nowhere to cause market sell-offs before getting pushed back down by the Fed to keep the markets healthy.   In the three other times that these have suddenly leaked out on green market days, there has been a VIX increase of 18-20% occur within 2 trading days afterwards.  The spike that leaked out is not random, it's almost a glitch in the system and offers us a hint that something is about to happen to the markets volatility very soon.

Tesla essentially killed it with earnings! I didn’t get to listen to the conference call but I hear they are thinking of a self driving vehicle subscription. Otherwise I didn’t hear any note worthy conference call news.

Being that its up 4.58% currently after market I don’t think there was anything scary either.

The key takeaways today for SPY were that 1. 447.2 is a MAJOR resistance that is going to take some time to get through and 2. 444 is a hella strong support that is also going to be tough to get through with 445 being noteworthy too. SPY continues to enjoy this sideways trading and to be honest I do too. I killed it today scalping these run ups and downs today. Ill take a day like this every single day.

Despite SPYs ability to do it today it FAILED to break the bear channel. This bear channel is utilizing the two most recent “highs” from March 29th and April 5th. That lower highs trend is still yet to be broken. Resistance will be at 447 tomorrow which is quite a peculiar resistance line with how strong that rejected us numerous times today. Support remains near 430 tomorrow.

Despite the bears managing to close SPY red today at 0.07% the bulls made headway today. The bulls were able to break above the daily 100 ema at 446 today. However, they failed to close above it and settled for a close above the daily 8, 20, and 50ema which sit at 444. 27/ 444.38 and 443.31. Overall despite the sideways burning day SPY did have bullish momentum. Tomorrow if bulls can break this above 448 we will see the daily bear channel broken and I do believe riding off of Teslas great earnings we could see a rip to 460 next week or end of month.

Apple enjoyed a sideways day too, however, struggled quite a bit more then SPY did today overall. We saw Apple reject the upward resistance line which is also its daily 20ema at 168.95 today. However, apple bulls are stacking candles on top of eachother now and I do suspect we will see this bear channel broke, especially with good news from the tesla earnings.  Apple closing above its daily 8ema is a bullish momentum move also. I fully expect apple to be able to have a green bull day near 170.5.

QQQ continues to stack candles higher also and appears to be establishing some bullish momentum. As I have mentioned before have suspect that the 338 level was the “bottom” for now. I fully expect to see 370-375 end of month without any bad news catalysts. QQQ while breaking the daily 8ema and touching the daily 20ema failed to close above either today. QQQ bulls will need to take this opportunity to close above those key resistance lines tomorrow in order to see a bull week next week.

The VIX enjoyed nothing but sideways trading all day today sticking to a tight $2.50 range almost all day.

The VIX is now trading within its recent “mean” with its recent range being 18.5 to 24.8. This lower vix is not only going to cause less volatility and smaller swings/ daily moves but its going to result in some more of these sideways boring days. With the VIX close to 18.5 then it has been since April 5th I will look for the bulls to take this as an opportunity to get this back to 450+. 

10% challenge-

Today was actually a hella good day on the server. I made/ called out 11 trades today and 10 of which were profitable (one did close at 0% but it was not red and I count that as a win). Here is my daily trade log

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 13%

4/20/2022 Call 2dte 24%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 10%

4/20/2022 Put 5dte -10%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 25%

4/20/2022 Put 0dte 60%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 50%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (apple) 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 put 2dte 15%

4/20/2022 Put (tesla) 2dte 18%

4/20/2022 Put 2dte 8%

This is I believe one of if not the most trades I have made in a single day of trading yet and with a 90.9% win rate on the day. I did throw two 0dte in there today but sticking to no 0 dte and a smaller position size of 2500/ trade has made a massive difference this week. I also had some people I feel “skeptical” of my actual trades and my log so today you will get a screenshot of my TOS. 

Today as you can see I actually played two Tesla “Lottos” I had planned these to be overnight puts for earnings but I was able to close one at 50% and one at 18% which pretty much allowed me to play the current 4/22 855P I have open for free. Obviously unless sentiment changes over night those are going to take quite a massive hit at open but with a big enough IV pump ill be content with a 50% loss on it. But it is what it is and was a true one contract LOTTO paid for by my daily tesla put profits. 

Hyperwheel I was able to sell 3 puts and close at 50% profits for an additional $203.64 in premium today. I currently have 3 puts open sitting at 30% profit I suspect I will roll tomorrow. 

hyperwheel return is 4.04% 

buy and hold is 2.06%
